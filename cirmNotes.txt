There is one file per cell, this many cells
   1,047    1047   52528
there are this many transcripts per file
 173,260  866300 5352029 A43D1_1_1_L13_C17_IL3545-708-503/abundance.txt
Therefore an expected 181,403,220 exp scores
there are this many lines total with a actual expression score
  14,794,718   88768308 1244772164 allNonNull.txt
around 8 % of the scores are non 0 

Need to identify a common intersection of the 173,260 transcripts across the 1,047 cell
lines

Each cell line has a .txt file that stores the information as a tab
deliminated table. Each row corresponds to a single transcript
GOAL: Identify the rows that have a score across all cell lines 
Picking a random file it has this many rows with 0 in them, 
172756
and therefore this many rows without 0, 504
