This directory contains the config files that are needed for the 
Genome Browser in a box. It should be possible to convert
a Ubuntu 13 installation into a Genome Browser in a box by copying all these
files into the root directory as sudo.

Change ownerships of /data/gbdb, /data/trash and /data/userdata to www-data and /data/mysql to mysql

This tree does not include the trash cleaner binaries as they are > 5MB.

All other changes of the box are documented in root/changes.txt
