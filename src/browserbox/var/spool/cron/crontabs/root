# These scripts can lock each other out to prevent overload protection
# on the filesystem where trash is located.  The measureTrash.sh script
# doesn't mind being locked out by the trash cleaner, it will just skip
# the measurement without error.
# But the trash cleaner does not like being locked out by
# the measureTrash script and will be considered an error.
# On really busy heavily used systems, beware of their run times overlapping
