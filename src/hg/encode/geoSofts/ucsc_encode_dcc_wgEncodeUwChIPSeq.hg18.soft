!Series_summary = This dataset is produced as part of the ENCODE Project and displays maps of histone modifications genome-wide in different cell lines, using ChIP-seq high-throughput sequencing.
!Series_summary = For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022  and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
!Series_overall_design = Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols. Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed in nuclei lysis buffer, and the chromatin was sheared to 200-500 bp fragments using Fisher Dismembrator (model 500). Sheared chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with specific polyclonal antibody at 4 degrees C with gentle rotation. Antibody-chromatin complexes were washed and eluted. The cross linking in immunoprecipitated DNA was reversed and treated with RNase-A. Following proteinase K treatment, the DNA fragments were purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. 20-50 ng of ChIP DNA was end-repaired, followed by the addition of adenine, ligated to Illumina adapters and made in to Solexa library for sequencing. The sequencing reads uniquely mapping to the hg18 reference human genome were then scored using a scan statistic based on the binomial distribution. Regions of significant tag enrichment (significance being gauged using an FDR procedure based on randomly generated data) were then resolved into 150 bp peaks called on a continuous, sliding window tag density representation of the data (Sabo et al., 2004). Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying correlation coefficient >0.9.
