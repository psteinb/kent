# Data Agreement File for Stanford/Yale RNA-seq experiments for mm9  

#$Revision: 1.3 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.


# The header for the associated DDF should look like this:
#files	view	cell	treatment 	replicate	rnaExtract  readType    localization	origAssembly	seqPlatform	labVersion       


#Explanation of DDF terms
#files: The name of the files to be associated with this data
#view: The type of view that these files are. The options are listed in this DAF
#cell: The cell or tissue name. The cell registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Mouse_cell_types
#treatment: The treatment used to treat a specific cell.The treatment registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Treatments
#replicate: The Replicate number. The replication number of a given experiment.
#rnaExctract:   The RNA extract.  http://hgwdev.cse.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#rnaExtract
#readType       the read type (single, paired, directional, length) (http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#readType)
#localization   the cellular compartment (http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#localization)
#origAssembly:  The assembly that the data was originally released on (hg18 or hg19)
#seqPlatform: The sequencing platform.The sequence platformregistered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Sequence_Platforms
#labVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of any other data
