# gtexSample.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gtexSample.c and gtexSample.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#GTEx sample description

    name varchar(255) not null,	# GTEX sample identifier

    donor varchar(255) not null,	# GTEX subject identifier
              #Indices
