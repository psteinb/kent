# wgEncodeGencodeSource.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeSource.c and wgEncodeGencodeSource.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Gencode metadata table of the source of Gencode Gene transcripts
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeSource (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# Transcript ID for Gencode gene

              #Indices
