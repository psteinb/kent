# wgEncodeGencodePubmed.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodePubmed.c and wgEncodeGencodePubmed.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Gencode metadata table of PubMed ID of published experimental data associated with Gencode Genes
