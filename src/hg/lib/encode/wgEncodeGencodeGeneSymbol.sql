# wgEncodeGencodeGeneSymbol.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeGeneSymbol.c and wgEncodeGencodeGeneSymbol.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Gencode metadata table of HGNC gene symbols for Gencode Genes
