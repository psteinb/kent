# wgEncodeGencodeUniProt.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeUniProt.c and wgEncodeGencodeUniProt.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Gencode metadata table of associated UniProt peptide IDs
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeUniProt (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# Transcript ID for Gencode gene
    uniProtId varchar(255) not null,	# UniProt/Swiss-Prot ID
