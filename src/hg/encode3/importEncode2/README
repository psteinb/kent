This contains a variety of programs used to reformat ENCODE2 metadata into formats hopefully 
easier to digest for ENCODE3.   The ENCODE2 data is stored in the hgFixed.encodeExp
and the genomic databases (hg19, mm9) metaDb tables,  and the cv.ra file.
This set of programs and scripts converts it into the encode2Meta database with a schema
described in encode2Meta.as.

The programs involved are:

1) encodeCvToDb - reads cv.ra and turns it into a directory of tab-separated files
   that you can turn into a SQL database.  Also produces Django models which we are
   no longer using, and .as files for documentation.  A script "tryIt" in the directory
   layers a process to split up antibody table on top of this.  Result needs to be
   loaded into MySQL in "kentDjangoTest2" database before you go to next step.
2) encodeExpToCvDb - reads in metaDb tables and the kentDjangoTest2 database,  produces
   experiment, series, and results tables to add to that database.
3) encode2ExpDumpFlat - produceds flattened output of experiment table, where numerical id's in
   vocab tables are replaced with tags.
