This the source code for the Encode Analysis Pipeline (EAP).  It is all available under the BSD 
license as part of the ENCODE Project.

The EAP is a system for running genomics pipelines implemented using mySQL, Parasol, and C.
The C code is
	eapDaemon - take anything in edwAnalysisJob table and feed it to Parasol
	eapSchedule - set up edwAnalysisJob and edwAnalysisRun tables make output temp dirs
	eapFinish - move stuff from output temp dirs into encode data warehouse
	eapMonitor - look at how jobs are progressing through table and parasol.  
	             If need be chill and kill steps gone awry.
