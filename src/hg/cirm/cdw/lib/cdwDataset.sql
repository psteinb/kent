# cdwDataset.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated cdwDataset.c and cdwDataset.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#A dataset is a collection of files, usually associated to a paper
