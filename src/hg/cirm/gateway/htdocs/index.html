      Welcome to the CIRM Genomics Hub, created from the Genomics Initiative from the
      California Institute for Regenerative Medicine's
      Center of Excellence for Stem Cell Genomics (CESCG).</p>

      <p>
      The CESCG is made up of approximately 20 separate projects, all involving stem
      or progenitor cells. The first release of information explores single cell expression
      datasets in the human brain, tools to deconvolute complex mixtures of brain cells
      into cell types and developmental states, and scorecards for in vitro differentiation
      into brain subclasses.</p>

      <p><h4>What is the CESCG?</h4></p>
      <p>
      Created in 2014 through a $40 million award by California's stem cell
      agency, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), the Center
      of Excellence in Stem Cell Genomics (CESCG) is spearheading the investigation
      into how stem cells can be used to treat disease.</p>

      <p>
      This Center merges the genomics expertise of the Stanford University research
      team under the seasoned leadership of Mike Snyder, with the cutting edge
      expertise of the Salk Institute and University of California, San Diego groups
      in epigenomics, led by Joseph Ecker. These two leaders in the field of genomics
      have extensive experience working on large-scale projects and have been working
      in national and international consortia for generating and distributing
      genomics data.  This Center of Excellence also includes the experience of Josh
      Stuart and David Haussler, leaders in data coordination and management, from
      the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), extending collaborative
      relationships that have been developed over the past decade.</p>

      <p><h4>CESCG's Vision</h4></p>
      <p>
      Our vision is to advance Stem Cell research in the State of California by
      establishing the Center of Excellence in Stem Cell Genomics (CESCG). The Center
      is generating banks of data and iPS cell lines that are valuable resources to
      the entire CIRM community and provide important insights into stem cell
      research. It also serves as an important focal point for collaborative projects
      with other CIRM investigators and makes genomics capabilities available to the
      entire regenerative medicine community.</p>
