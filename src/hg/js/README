The js directory should hold all refereenced javascript files for normal browser CGIs.

The contents includes the versions of jQuery package files mostly unmodified by UCSC, 
as well as several that are specific tothe browser.  Files should be named for the 
CGI or the library that uses them:
   hgTracks.js  included by hgTracks CGI.
   hui.js       included by hui.c library code.
   utils.js     common utilities included by multiple CGIs.

The "make alpha" command will place all files in JS_FILES and STATIC_FILES in
apache/htdocs/js/.  "make user" will place both sets in apache/htdocs-{user}/js if it
exists, and otherwise will place JS_FILES in apache/htdocs/js/{user} and skip
STATIC_FILES.  STATIC_FILES cannot be installed to apache/htdocs/js/{user} because
the static documents won't know to look there, and cannot be installed to htdocs/js
because that would require "make user" to clobber files placed by "make alpha".

In order to avoid caching errors by client browsers, the CGIs reference these files by
a symlink that contains the timestamp of the file.  The symlink is created by the CGIs if
not found.

IMPORTANT:
In for a user to test changes to javascript files on a named browser a setting must be 
added to the hg.conf file of that browser.  For example for the browser "hgwdev-larrym",
if apache/htdocs-larrym/ exists then the following line should appear in
apache/cgi-bin-larrym/hg.conf:
   browser.documentRoot=/usr/local/apache/htdocs-larrym

If that directory does not exist, then the following line must appear in
apache/cgi-bin-larrym/hg.conf instead:
   browser.javaScriptDir=js/larrym

This will allow the CGIs to find the js files that "make" copies into place.
