The js directory should hold all refereenced javascript files for normal browser CGIs.

The contents includes the versions of jQuery package files mostly unmodified by UCSC, 
as well as several that are specific tothe browser.  Files should be named for the 
CGI or the library that uses them:
   hgTracks.js  included by hgTracks CGI.
   hui.js       included by hui.c library code.
   utils.js     common utilities included by multiple CGIs.

The "make alpha", "make beta", and "make install" commands will place all files in
JS_FILES and STATIC_FILES in apache/htdocs/js/.  "make user" will place both sets in
apache/htdocs-{user}/js if it exists, and otherwise will place both sets in
apache/htdocs/js/{user}.  Static documents are hardcoded to look in /js, not /js/{user},
so any changes placed in /js/{user} will be ignored by static documents.  If you want to
modify those files and see the changes, you need to either have your own htdocs directory
or test your changes on "make alpha".

In order to avoid caching errors by client browsers, the CGIs reference these files by
symlinks that contain the timestamps of the files.  The symlinks are created by this
makefile, which runs cpAndLinkToResourceFiles.pl on the JS_FILES list.

IMPORTANT:
In for a user to test changes to javascript files on a named browser a setting must be 
added to the hg.conf file of that browser.  For example for the browser "hgwdev-larrym",
if apache/htdocs-larrym/ exists then the following line should appear in
apache/cgi-bin-larrym/hg.conf:
   browser.documentRoot=/usr/local/apache/htdocs-larrym

If that directory does not exist, then the following line must appear in
apache/cgi-bin-larrym/hg.conf instead:
   browser.javaScriptDir=js/larrym

This will allow the CGIs to find the js files that "make" copies into place.
