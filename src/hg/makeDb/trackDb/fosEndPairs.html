<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A valid pair of fosmid end sequences must be
at least 30 kb but no more than 50 kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first fosmid end sequence must be &quot;+&quot; and
the orientation of the second fosmid end sequence must be &quot;-&quot;.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2> <P> End sequences were trimmed at the NCBI using
ssahaCLIP written by Jim Mullikin.  Trimmed fosmid end sequences were
placed on the assembled sequence using Jim Kent's 
<A HREF="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/656.abstract" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
program. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> Sequencing of the fosmid ends was done at the 
<A HREF="http://www.broadinstitute.org/" TARGET=_blank>Eli & Edythe L. Broad
Institute</A> of MIT and Harvard University.  Clones are available through the
<A HREF="http://bacpac.chori.org/home.htm" TARGET=_blank>BACPAC Resources
Center</A> at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI).
