<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Most proteins are composed of one or more conserved functional regions called
domains. This track shows the high-quality, manually-curated
<a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
Pfam-A</a>
domains found in transcripts located in the UCSC Genes track.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene
tracks</a>.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The sequences from the knownGenePep table (see 
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=knownGene">UCSC Genes description page</a>)
are submitted to the set of Pfam-A HMMs which annotate regions within the
predicted peptide that are recognizable as Pfam protein domains. These regions
are then mapped to the transcripts themselves using the
<a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/" target="_blank">
pslMap utility</a>.
</p>
