This directory contains the track database for
the UCSC human genome browser.  The program
hgTrackDb converts the information here into
a 'trackDb' table in the assembly's MySQL database.

SEE ALSO: source tree file: src/product/README.trackDb
	  for a general discussion of developing tracks.

          trackDb.ra documentation:
          http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/trackDb/trackDbDoc.html

	  http://genome.ucsc.edu/admin/hgFindSpecHowTo.html

The bulk of the information about a track is
contained in the trackDb.ra file.  Tracks are
separated from each other in this file by
a blank line.  Each line begins with an
attribute name and is followed by attribute
value separated by white space.

The html text about a track is in separate
files named xxx.html where xxx is a
track name.  The contents of the HTML is subject
to variable substitution as described below.
Note that the html file in lower-level directories
can override the html in higher-level directories
without requiring an entry in trackDb.ra.

There may be subdirectories for each organism such
as 'mouse', and underneath these directories for
each database, such as 'mm10'.  There are a trackDb.ra
file and xxx.html files in these subdirectories.
Track descriptions in the subdirectory will
over-ride track descriptions in the parent directory.
This allows you to customize a track for
each version of the database.

xxx.html files may include the contents of other files
using this syntax:

<!--#insert file="sharedText.html"-->

where "sharedText.html" is a relative path, relative to
the directory that contains the xxx.html file.
This can also be made conditional on a database:

<!-- #if (db==hg19) #insert file="human/hg19/specialNote.html" -->


After editing a track definition here, run ./loadTracks
which invokes hgTrackDb to bring it into the MySQL database.
To update your personal copy (on hgwdev-userName) do
    make update
to do it on genome-test do
    make alpha
You can also restrict a track to alpha, beta, or public
by using the release field.
