M&egrave;dica (IMIM) / Centre de Regulaci&oacute; Gen&ograve;mica (CRG) in Barcelona.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Geneid is a program to predict genes in anonymous genomic sequences designed 
with a hierarchical structure. In the first step, splice sites, start and stop 
codons are predicted and scored along the sequence using Position Weight Arrays 
(PWAs). Next, exons are built from the sites. Exons are scored as the sum of the 
scores of the defining sites, plus the the log-likelihood ratio of a 
Markov Model for coding DNA. Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene 
structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons.
