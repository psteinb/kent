 <P><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #c70000;">NOTE:</span><br> 
 While the DECIPHER database is 
 open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
 genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
 diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
 </P>
 <P>Because the UCSC Genes mappings for CNVs are based on associations from
 RefSeq and UniProt, they are dependent on any interpretations from those
 sources.  Furthermore, because many DECIPHER records refer to multiple gene
 names, or syndromes not tightly mapped to individual genes, the associations
 in this track should be treated with skepticism and any conclusions
 based on them should be carefully scrutinized using independent
 resources.
 </P>
 <p><b>Data Display Agreement Notice</b><br>
 These data are only available for display in the Browser, and not for bulk
 download.  Access to bulk data may be obtained directly from DECIPHER
 (<a href='http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/datasharing' target='_blank'
 >http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/datasharing</a>) and is subject to a
 Data Access Agreement, in which the user certifies that no attempt to
 identify individual patients will be undertaken.  The same restrictions
 apply to the public data displayed at UCSC in the UCSC Genome Browser;
 no one is authorized to attempt to identify patients by any means.
 </p>
 <p>These data are made available as soon as possible and may be a
 pre-publication release.  For information on the proper use of DECIPHER

 <p>The DECIPHER consortium provides these data in good faith as a research
 tool, but without verifying the accuracy, clinical validity, or utility of
 the data.  The DECIPHER consortium makes no warranty, express or implied,

<P>
The 
<A HREF="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk" TARGET=_BLANK>DECIPHER</A>
database of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance 
collects clinical information about chromosomal 
microdeletions/duplications/insertions, translocations and inversions, 
and displays this information on the human genome map.
<p>
This track shows genomic regions of reported cases and their 
associated phenotype information.  All data have passed the strict
consent requirements of the DECIPHER project and are approved for
unrestricted public release.  Clicking the Patient View ID link
brings up a more detailed informational page on the patient at the 
DECIPHER web site. 
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Data provided by the DECIPHER project group are imported and processed 
to create a simple BED track to annotate the genomic regions associated 
with individual patients.  
</P>
<P>
For the CNVs track, the entries are colored <B><FONT COLOR = RED>red</FONT></B> for deletions 
(mean log ratio &lt; 0) and <B><FONT COLOR = BLUE>blue</FONT></B> for duplications 
(mean log ratio &gt; 0).  Entries where no mean ratio is available are colored
<b><font color="#888">grey</font></b>.
<br>
For the SNVs track, the entries are colored according to the estimated pathogenicity of the
variant.  Entries are colored <b><font color="black">black for likely or definitely
pathogenic</font></b>, <b><font color="#888">dark grey for uncertain or
unknown</font></b>, and <b><font color="#c8c8c8">light grey for likely or definitely
benign</font></b>.
