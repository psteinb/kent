<H2>Description</H2> 
<P>
The deCODE recombination rate track represents
calculated rates of recombination based on the
deCODE recombination maps in 10 Kb bins from October 2010.
Sex averaged-, Female- and male-specific recombination rates
can be displayed by choosing the appropriate options on the track 
description page.</P>
<P>
Corresponding to each of these tracks separate
tracks for carriers and non-carriers of the PRDM9 14/15 composite
allele can be displayed as  well.  There are also tracks depicting
the difference between male- and female- recombination rates, and a
track showing recombination hotspots, i.e. bins with standardized
recombination rates higher than 10.</P>
<P>
In addition to the deCODE display, three data tracks from the
<A HREF="http://snp.cshl.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>HapMap project</A>
are included.  CEU, YRI and combined maps from release #24 can be
turned on with the track visibility controls.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The deCODE genetic map was created at 
<A HREF="http://www.decode.com/" TARGET=_blank>deCODE Genetics</A> and is 
based on 289,658 and 8,411 SNPs on the autosomal and X chromosomes
for 15,257 parent-offspring pairs.  For more information on this map, see
<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09525.html"
TARGET = _BLANK>Kong, A. <em>et al.</em> (2010).</A></P>
<P>
Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by
assuming a linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking
genetic markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 10 Kb window
is the average recombination rate of the bases contained within the
window.  The recombination rates are standardized, bringing the average
to 1 for all bins used for the standardization.</P>

<P>
This track was produced at UCSC using data that are freely available for
the deCODE genetic maps.  Thanks to all who played a part in the
creation of these maps.</P>
