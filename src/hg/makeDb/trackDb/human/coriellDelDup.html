<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Coriell Cell Line Deletion and Duplication track shows
genotyping of chromosomal aberration and inherited disorder samples
from an NIGMS study <A HREF = 
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000269.v1.p1" 
TARGET = _BLANK>
dbGaP Study Accession: phs000269.v1.p1.</A>
</P>

<P>
716 samples derived from 697 individuals 
from the Chromosomal Aberrations and Inherited Disorders collections of the 
NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository were genotyped and analyzed for CNVs 
by the Microarray Center at the Coriell Institute for Medical 
Research. 
</P>

<p>
Karyotyping was performed on all cell cultures in the Repository with
reported chromosome abnormalities. The samples chosen for genotyping in
this study are intended to represent a diverse set of copy-number variants,
but the selection was also weighted to over-sample commonly manifested types
of aberrations. When available, the ISCN description of the sample, based
on G-banding and FISH analysis, is included in the phenotypic data.
Karyotypes for these cells can be viewed in the 
<A HREF ="http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NIGMS/?SsId=8"

<P>
Field definitions for an item description:
<UL>
<LI><B>CN State:</B> Copy Number of the imbalance.  Note that a
  copy number of 2 is colored neutral (black), but all such items
  occur on the sex chromosomes, so this should not be interpreted
  as normal, as it would be on an autosome.</LI>
<LI><B>Cell Type: </B>Type of cell culture; one of the following: 
  B Lymphocyte, Fibroblast, Amniotic fluid-derived cell line or 
  Chorionic villus-derived cell line.</LI>
<LI><B>Description (Diagnosis): </B> May be a medical diagnosis,
  such as "albinism" or a chromosomal phenotype, such as 
  "translocation."</LI>
<LI><B>ISCN nomenclature: </B> A description of the chromosomal
  karyotype, in formal ISCN nomenclature.  </LI>
</UL>

<P>
CN State item coloring:
<UL>
<LI style="color: #ff0000;">CN State 0 == score 0</li>
<LI style="color: #aa4400;">CN State 1 == score 100</li>
<LI style="color: #000000;">CN State 2 == score 200</li>
<LI style="color: #0044aa;">CN State 3 == score 300</li>
<LI style="color: #0000ff;">CN State 4 == score 400</li>
</UL>

Use the score filter limits on the configuration page
to select out the different CN State items.
