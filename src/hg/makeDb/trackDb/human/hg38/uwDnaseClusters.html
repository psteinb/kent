<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows DNase hypersensitive areas assayed in a 95 cell types
by the John Stamatoyannapoulos lab at the University of Washington as part
<a target=_blank href="http://encodeproject.org">ENCODE project</a> during
the first production and analysis phase of the project (Sept. 2007 - Jan 2011).
Regulatory regions in general, and promoters in particular, tend to be DNase-sensitive.  
</p>
Additional views of this data and additional documentation on the methods used
to identify hypersensitive sites are available from the
<a target=_blank href=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=uwEnc2Dnase>UW DNaseI HS</a> track.
The peaks in that track are the basis for the clusters shown here,  
which combine data from the peaks of the different cell lines.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
A gray box indicates the extent of the hypersensitive region.  
The darkness is proportional to the maximum signal strength observed in any cell line.  
The number to the left of the box shows how many cell lines are hypersensitive in the region.  
The track can be configured to restrict the display to elements above a specified score 
in the range 1-1000 (where score is based on signal strength).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Peaks of DNaseI hypersensitivity from the ENCODE DNase Analysis Pipeline at UCSC
were assigned normalized scores (by UCSC regClusterMakeTableOfTables) in the range 0-1000 based
on the 
<a target=_blank href="../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12">narrowPeak</a> 
signalValue and then clustered on score (by UCSC regCluster) to generate singly-linked clusters.

This track is based on sequence data from the University of Washington ENCODE group, 
with subsequent processing by UCSC.
