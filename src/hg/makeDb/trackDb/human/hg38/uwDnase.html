<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks contain the results of DNAse I hypersensitivity experiments performed by the
John Stamatoyannapoulos lab at the University of Washington for the 
<a href="http://encodeproject.org">ENCODE Project</a>
during the period September 2007 through January 2011.
<p>
The primary data for this track (along with methods descriptions, credits and references) on
which this track is based are available from the
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeUwDnase">ENCODE UW DnaseI HS track</a>
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track is a composite annotation track containing multiple subtracks, one for each cell type.
The display mode and filtering of each subtrack can be individually controlled. 
For more information about track configuration, see

<p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The raw sequence data files were processed according to the ENCODE DNase analysis pipeline
defined in July 2014 (need ref).
Briefly, sequence files were aligned to the hg38 (GRCh38) genome assembly augmented with 'sponge'
sequence (ref).  Multi-mapped reads were removed, as were reads that aligned to 'sponge' or
mitochondiral sequence.  Results from all replicates were pooled, and further processed by
the Hotspot program to call peaks as well as broader regions of activity ('hotspots), and to 
create signal density graphs.
Signal graphs were normalized so the average value genome-wide is 1.
