<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates differences in this human genome assembly,
GRCh38 (hg38), from the previous version, GRCh37 (hg19).
Contigs used in the assembly of GRCh38 (hg38) that were not
present in GRCh37 (hg19) are shown.

The following color/score key is used:

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for the assemblies.
Contigs that match the same name, same version, and the same specific
portion of sequence are noted as identical in the two
assemblies.  Contigs not satisifying those identical characteristics are
included in this track.
