<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Chemical modifications (e.g., methylation and acetylation) to the histone proteins
present in chromatin influence gene expression by changing how
accessible the chromatin is to transcription. A specific modification of
a specific histone protein is called a histone mark.
This track shows the levels of enrichment of the H3K4Me3 histone mark across the genome as
determined by a ChIP-seq assay. The H3K4Me3 histone mark is the tri-methylation of lysine 4 of the
H3 histone protein, and it is associated with promoters that are active or poised to be
activated.  Additional histone marks and other chromatin associated ChIP-seq data is available at 
the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeBroadHistone" target="_blank">Broad Histone</a>
page.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
By default, this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell
lines in the same vertical space.  Each of the cell lines in this track is associated with a
particular color, and these cell line colors are consistent across all tracks that
are part of the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeReg">ENCODE Regulation</a>
supertrack (colors assigned by BigWigCluster).
These colors are relatively light and saturated so as to work best with the transparent overlay.  
Unfortunately, outside the ENCODE Regulation tracks, older cell line
color conventions are used that don't match the cell line colors used in
the ENCODE Regulation tracks. The older colors were not used in the
ENCODE Regulation tracks because they were too dark for the transparent
overlay.

<h2>Data Release Policy</h2>
<p>
Primary ENCODE data produced during the 2007-2012 production phase were subject to a restriction
period.  However, the data here are past those restrictions and are freely available.
The full data release policy for ENCODE is available
<a href="../ENCODE/terms.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
