<!--#insert file="omimDescriptionText.html"-->

<P>
This track shows the <B>allelic variants</B> in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="http://www.omim.org/" TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database that have associated
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP</A> identifiers.
</P>
 
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic positions of OMIM allelic variants are marked by solid blocks, which appear
as tick marks when zoomed out.  
<P> The details page for each variant displays the allelic variant description, the amino
acid replacement, and the associated
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> and/or
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/" target="_blank">ClinVar</a> identifiers with links to the
variant's details at those resources.
</P>
<P>The descriptions of OMIM entries are shown on the main browser display when Full display
mode is chosen.  In Pack mode, the descriptions are shown when mousing over each entry.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was constructed as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM allelic variant data file <TT>mimAV.txt</TT> was obtained from OMIM and
loaded into the MySQL table <TT>omimAv</TT>.
<LI>The genomic position for each allelic variant in <TT>omimAv</TT> with an associated
dbSnp identifier was obtained from the <TT>snp150</TT> table. The OMIM AV identifiers and
their corresponding genomic positions from dbSNP were then loaded into the <TT>omimAvSnp</TT>
table.
</UL>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to OMIM and NCBI for the use of their data. This track was constructed by Fan Hsu,
Robert Kuhn, and Brooke Rhead of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group.</P>
