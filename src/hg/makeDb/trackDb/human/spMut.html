This track is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the genome browser database
is open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.</p></div>

<P>
This track shows the genomic positions of amino-acid variants.
of natural protein variants in the UniProt/SwissProt Database (<A
HREF="http://www.uniprot.org/" TARGET=_blank>uniprot.org</A>).  The data has 
been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt staff.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt variants are labelled with the
the amino acid change at a given position and, if known, the abbreviated disease name.
A "?" is used if there is no disease annotated at this location, but the protein is described as being linked to only a single disease in UniProt.</P>
<P>Mouse over a mutation to see the UniProt comments.</P>
<P>Artificially introduced
mutations are colored in green, naturally occuring variants in red.  
For the full information about a particular variant, click the "UniProt variant" linkout.  
The "UniProt record" linkout lists all variants of a particular protein sequence and 
"Publications" links to the articles in Pubmed that originally described the variant(s) and were
used as evidence by the UniProt curators.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
UniProt sequences were aligned to RefSeq sequences first with BLAT, then lifted
to genome positions with pslMap.  UniProt variants were parsed from the UniProt
XML file.  The variants were then mapped to the genome through the alignment
using the pslMap program.  This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/"
TARGET="_BLANK">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. The complete script is
part of the kent source tree and located in src/hg/utils/uniprotMutations.
