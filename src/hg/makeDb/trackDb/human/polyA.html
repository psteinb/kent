<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The polyA_DB database is a set of $organism mRNA polyadenlyation sites based
on EST/cDNA evidence.  
A site is a single base denoting the beginning of a poly(A) tail in a nascent
mRNA transcript and is typically 10-30 nucleotides downstream of a 
polyadenylation signal (most commonly AAUAAA).
The polyA_DB web server is found at 
<A HREF="http://exon.umdnj.edu/polya_db">http://exon.umdnj.edu/polya_db</A>.
</P>
<P>
The Poly(A) composite track consists of two subtracks: a polyA_DB 
subtrack that displays reported poly(A) sites, and a poly(A) 
prediction subtrack that displays poly(A) sites predicted using a
support vector machine (SVM). 
</P> 
<P>
The poly(A) predictions are made using 1500-base DNA sequences centered at 
the end of each RefSeq gene.  The sequences serve as input into the 
SVM described in Cheng <EM>et al.</EM>, 2006.  The SVM scores 
each base
using a model derived from 15 different cis-elements and reports an E-value for
a region of DNA between 0 (excellent) and 0.5 (worst).  This E-value is then
normalized to an integer value between 0 (worst) and 1000 (excellent).  
High-scoring 
regions are highlighted, with the highest-scoring base indicated by a thicker 
line.  The median length of these regions is 48 bases.
