LOVD is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the LOVD database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.  Further, please be
sure to click through to <a href = "http://lovd.nl"
target="_blank">lovd.nl</a> for the very latest, as they are continually 
updating data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #c70000;">DOWNLOADS:</span><br>
LOVD databases are owned by their respective curators
and are not available for download or mirroring 
by any third party without their permission.  Please see the list on
<a href= "http://lovd.nl/2.0/index_list.php" target="_blank">LOVD.nl</A>
for a list of database installations and the respective curators.

<P>
This track shows the genomic positions of all <B>public</B> entries in public
installations of the Leiden Open Variation Database system (<A
HREF="http://www.lovd.nl/" TARGET=_blank>LOVD</A>).  
UCSC does not host any further information.  To get details on a mutation
(bibliographic reference, phenotype, disease, patient, etc.), follow the
"LinkOut" to the central server at Leiden, which will then redirect you to the
details page at the right LOVD installation for a variation.</P>

<P>LOVD is a flexible, freely available tool for Gene-centered collection and
display of DNA variations.  It is not a database itself but rather a platform
where curators store and analyze data.  While the LOVD team and the biggest LOVD
sites are run at the Leiden University Medical Center, LOVD installations and their
curators are spread over the whole world.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic locations of LOVD variation entries are labeled with the gene symbol
and the description of the mutation according to <A
HREF="http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/" TARGET=_blank>Human Gene Variation Society
standards</A>. For instance the label AGRN:c.172G&gt;A means that the cDNA of AGRN is
mutated from G to A at position 172.

<P>All other information is shown on the respective LOVD variation page, accessible via the "Outside Link" above.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mappings displayed in this track were provided by LOVD.
