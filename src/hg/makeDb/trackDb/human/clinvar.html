ClinVar is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the ClinVar database is
open to all academic users, users seeking information about a personal medical
or genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.</p>

This track shows the genomic positions of variants in the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/" target="_blank">ClinVar database</a>. 
ClinVar is a free, public archive of reports
of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting
evidence.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of ClinVar variants are labeled with the ClinVar variant
descriptions. All information related to each is variant is shown on that
variant's details page.  Leave the mouse over a feature for more than 2 seconds
to show the clinical significance of a variant.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
ClinVar files were reformatted at UCSC to the <a href="../goldenPath/help/bigBed.html">bigBed</a> format.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
Thanks to NCBI for making the ClinVar data available on their FTP site.
