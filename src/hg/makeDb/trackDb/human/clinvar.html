ClinVar is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the ClinVar database is
open to all academic users, users seeking information about a personal medical
or genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.</p>

<p>
This track shows the genomic positions of variants in the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/" target="_blank">ClinVar database</a>. 
ClinVar is a free, public archive of reports
of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting
evidence.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of ClinVar variants are labeled with the ClinVar variant
descriptions. All information related to each is variant is shown on that
variant's details page.  Leave the mouse over a feature for more than 2 seconds
to show the clinical significance of a variant.
</p>

<p>The track is divided into two subtracks, one for copy number variants, these
are typically a lot larger, and a second track for short substitutions and indels.</p>

<H2>Data access</H2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>.
For automated download and analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that
can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/bbi/" target="_blank">our download server</a>.
The files for this track are called <tt>clinVarMain.bb</tt> and <tt>clinVarCnv.bb</tt>. Individual
regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool
can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, e.g. 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/bbi/clinvar/clinvarMain.bb -chrom=chr21 -start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</tt></p>
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
ClinVar files were reformatted at UCSC to the <a href="../goldenPath/help/bigBed.html">bigBed</a> format.
The data is updated every month, one week after the ClinVar release date.
The exact procedure is available on <a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/utils/otto/clinvar/clinVarToBed">Github</a>.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
Thanks to NCBI for making the ClinVar data available on their FTP site as a tab-separated file.
