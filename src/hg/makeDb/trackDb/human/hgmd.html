HGMD public is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the HGMD public database is
open to all academic users, users seeking information about a personal medical
or genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.</p>

<P>
This track shows the genomic positions of variants in the Human 
Gene Mutation Database (<A HREF="http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php" TARGET=_blank>HGMD</A>).  
UCSC does not host any further information.  To get details on a mutation
(bibliographic reference, phenotype, disease, patient, etc.), follow the
link at the top of the details page.</P>

<P>Mouse over to show the type of variant (substitution, insertion, deletion,
regulatory or splice variant).  For deletions only start coordinates are shown
as the end coordinates have not been provided by HGMD.  They are available by
following the link. Insertions are located between the two highlighted nucleic
acids.</P>

<P>The HGMD public database is produced at Cardiff University but is free only
for academic use.  Academic users need to register with HGMD and login there.
UCSC provides only the coordinates of mutations and no further annotation.
Annotation details can also not be downloaded from UCSC.  Download and
commercial use requires a license from HGMD. </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic locations of HGMD variants are labeled with the gene symbol
and the accession of the mutation, separated by a colon. All other information
is shown on the respective HGMD variation page, accessible via the outlink at
the top of the
details page.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mappings displayed in this track were obtained from the NCBI ClinVar FTP
server and reformatted at UCSC as a BED file. </P>
