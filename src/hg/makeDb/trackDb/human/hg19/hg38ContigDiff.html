<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates differences in genome assembly 
GRCh37/hg19 when compared to the next version GRCh38/hg38. 
Contigs used in this assembly, GRCh37/hg19,
that were not carried forward to GRCh38/hg38 are shown.

The following color/score key is used:

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for the assemblies.
Contigs that match the same name, same version, and the same specific
portion of sequence are noted as identical in the two
assemblies.  Contigs not satisifying those identical characteristics are
included in this track.
