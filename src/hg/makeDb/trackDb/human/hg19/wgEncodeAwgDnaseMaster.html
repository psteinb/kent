The DHSs called on individual cell-types were consolidated into a master list of 2,890,742 unique, non-overlapping DHS positions by first merging the FDR 1% peaks across all cell-types. Then, for each resulting interval of merged sites, the DHS with the highest z-score was selected for the master list. Any DHSs overlapping the peaks selected for the master list were then discarded. The remaining DHSs were then merged and the process repeated until each original DHS was either in the master list, or discarded. Each master list DHS is annotated with the number of cell-types whose original DHSs overlap the master list DHS.
