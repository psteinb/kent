<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ENCODE project has revealed the functional elements of segments
of the human genome in unprecedented detail. However, the ability to
clearly distinguish transcripts designated for translation into protein
versus those that serve purely regulatory roles remains elusive. The
standard means for doing this is to measure the proteins, if any, that
are produced by transcripts via mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic
mapping. In this process, chromatographically fractionated peptides are
fed into a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). The series of fragment
masses produced in MS/MS create a signature that can then be used to
identify the peptide from a protein or DNA sequence database. For
proteogenomic mapping, this identifying spectrum is mapped directly
back to its most likely encoding locus on a genome sequence[1]. This
allows the direct verification of protein-encoding transcripts.</p>
<p>The proteogenomic track displays mass spectrometry data that has
been matched to the genomic sequence for selected cell lines, using a
workflow and software specifically designed for this purpose. </p>
<p>The proteogenomic tracks can be used to identify which parts of the
genome are translated into proteins, to verify which transcripts
discovered by ENCODE are protein-encoding, and can also reveal new
genes and/or splice variants of genes. Of particular interest may be
its ability to reveal the translation of small ORFs, antisense
transcripts, or sites annotated as introns that encode proteins
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>The display for this track show peptide mappings as
grayscale-colored items where higher scores correspond to
darker-colored blocks.</p>
<p>There are several new nonstandard BED fields are added for this
track. For example, there are three fields provided to assess the
veracity of a match. The first is the <i>Raw Score </i> of the
peptide. As the fields <i> Score </i> actually represents the
confidence of identification (-log10(EValue)) for the peptide, we are
providing raw score for that peptide to assess peptide identification
(Jainab: how can users interpret this score?&nbsp; What constitutes a
"good" score?). The second is the <i>Rank of the peptide</i> which
indicates which position this particular peptide match was (those &gt;
rank 5 are automatically eliminated) for that spectrum (Jainab: the
word "position" is a bit confusing here.&nbsp; Perhaps more detail
would help). Since a spectrum can be chimeric, containing more than one
peptide, it is possible to obtain more than one valid match for the
spectrum against the genome. A third field <i> Peptide Repeat Count</i>
indicates how many places in the genome have the same matching peptide
sequence, i.e. its uniqueness. The method may find a very strong match
to a given peptide sequence X, but if X is present at three places in
the genome, then we cannot be sure which of those locations encoded the
protein observed. </p>
<p>Another field <i>Precursor M/Z</i> represents the mass over charge
ratio of the digested peptide before it was further dissociated by mass
spectrometry. This is a semi unique identifier of the peptide that can
be used to track its origins. </p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ENCODE cell lines K562 and GM12878 were used for large scale
proteomic analysis. Cell lines were cultured according to standard
ENCODE cell culture protocols
and in-gel digestion was completed according to the standard
protocol[3]. </p>
The proteolytic enzyme <i>trypsin</i> was used to digest the proteins
in order to produce short, MS/MS analyzable peptides. Trypsin is a
common protease that typically cleaves proteins after R or K. The
parameter <i>enzyme</i> specifies the restriction enzyme used for
digestion. Tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS) analysis was then
performed on an Eksigent Ultra-LTQ Orbitrap system.&nbsp; However, due
to enzyme inefficiency, it does not always cleave at R or K, so there
may be peptides that include an uncleaved R/K site. The number of such
missed cleavages allowed in the search is described by the parameter <i>miscleavages</i>.
<p>We performed proteogenomic mapping with two miscleavages allowed and
using whole human genomic sequence (UCSC hg19) via the genome
fingerprint scanning (GFS) program [2], which uses HMM_Score [4] to
accurately match MS/MS spectra to their corresponding genome sequences.
E-values are calculated for all results, which estimate the number of
results at the given score level which would be expected by random
chance. The E-values are used to assess the false-positive rate, and
only those matches falling within the specified 5% FPR rate
are included in the track. </p>
