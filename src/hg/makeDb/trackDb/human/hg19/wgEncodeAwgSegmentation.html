<h1>Overview</h1>
This set of tracks represents multivariate genome-segmentation results based on ENCODE data (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). Using two different unsupervised machine learning techniques (ChromHMM and Segway), the genome was automatically segmented into disjoint segments. Each segment belongs to one of a few specific genomic "states" which is assigned an intuitive label. Each genomic state represents a particular combination and distribution of different ENCODE functional data tracks such as histone modifications, open chromatin data and specific TF binding data. A consensus unified segmentation was also generated by reconciling results from the individual segmentations. These segmentations were performed on several ENCODE cell lines. The specific descriptions for each segmentation are listed below.

<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
The number and type of Segmentation states from the individual segmentations differ, 
but are unified via grouping by color (10 groups for ChromHMM and Segway, 7 for the Combined).
The display can be filtered to selected groups using the 'Filter by Segment Type' control on the
track configuration page.  Groupings that are not represented in the Combined tracks are marked
in the menu with an asterisk.

<h1>ChromHMM Segmentations</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<P>
A common set of states across <A TARGET=ucscVocab HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?term=GM12878,H1-hESC,K562,HeLa-S3,HepG2,HUVEC">six human cell types</a> (GM12878, H1-hESC, K562, HeLa-S3, HepG2, HUVEC) were learned by
computationally integrating ChIP-seq data for
<A TARGET=ucscVocab HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?term=CTCF,H3K4me1,H3K4me2,H3K4me3,H3K27ac,H3K9ac,H3K36me3,H4K20me1,H3K27me3,Input">8 chromatin marks, input data and the CTCF transcription factor</a>, two DNase-seq assays and a FAIRE-seq assay,
using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In total, twenty-five states were used to
segment the genome, and these states were then grouped and colored to
highlight predicted functional elements.
There are 6 ChromHMM tracks. Each track represents the segmentation results for each of the six cell lines.<br>

was binarized separately at a 200 base pair resolution based on a Poisson
background model. The chromatin states were learned from this binarized data
using a multivariate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that explicitly models the
combinatorial patterns of observed modifications (Ernst and Kellis, 2010).
To learn a common set of states across the six cell types, first the genomes were concatenated
across the cell types. For each of the six cell types, each 200 base pair interval
was then assigned to its most likely state under the model.

Using the ENCODE regions (spanning 1% of the human genome) the chromatin states were learned from this data using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) (Hoffman, et al. 2012). Models were learned separately for each of the six cell types. For each of the six cell types, the Viterbi algorithm was used to assign genomic regions to individual state labels at single base pair resolution over the entire genome.

<h1>Combined Segmentations</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<P>These tracks display chromatin state segmentations from 6 cell lines, using a consensus merge of the segmentations produced by the ChromHMM and Segway software.
In both segmentations, sets of states across <A TARGET=ucscVocab HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?term=GM12878,K562,H1-hESC,HeLa-S3,HepG2,HUVEC">six human cell types</a> were learned by computationally integrating ChIP-seq data for <A TARGET=ucscVocab HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?term=CTCF,H3K4me1,H3K4me2,H3K4me3,H3K27ac,H3K9ac,H3K36me3,H4K20me1,H3K27me3,Input">ten factors plus input</a>, two DNase-seq assays and a FAIRE-seq assay. In both segmentations, twenty-five states were used to segment the genome, and these states were then grouped and colored to highlight predicted functional elements. For ease of comprehension and display, the merged segmentation uses only seven states.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<P>ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE Consortium was used to generate this track, and the ChromHMM and Segway programs were used to perform the segmentation. For both original segmentations, data for <A TARGET=ucscVocab HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?term=CTCF,H3K4me1,H3K4me2,H3K4me3,H3K27ac,H3K9ac,H3K36me3,H4K20me1,H3K27me3,Input">ten factors plus input</a>, two DNase-seq assays and a FAIRE-seq assay

was used.
<p>
For ChromHMM, the data was binarized separately at a 200 base pair resolution based on a Poisson
background model. The chromatin states were learned from this binarized data
using a multivariate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that explicitly models the
combinatorial patterns of observed modifications (Ernst and Kellis, 2010).
To learn a common set of states across the six cell types, first the genomes were concatenated
across the cell types. For each of the six cell types, each 200 base pair interval
was then assigned to its most likely state under the model. 
</p>
<p>
For Segway, the data converted to real valued signal data using the Wiggler program. Using the ENCODE regions (spanning 1% of the human genome) the chromatin states were learned from this data using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) (Hoffman, et al. 2012).
Models were learned separately for each of the six cell types. For each of the six cell types, the Viterbi algorithm was used to assign genomic regions to individual state labels at single base pair resolution over the entire genome.
</p>
<p>
To form the combined segmentation, for each original segmentation, we identified states that could be grouped based on similar signal patterns. For the ChromHMM segmentation, the states were grouped manually based on the mean signal values across multiple cell lines. For the Segway segmentations run independently over multiple cell lines, multiple hierarchical clustering techniques were applied across all states in the segmentations to identify the most consistent clustering of states, both across cell lines and with respect to existing biological knowledge.  Using these criteria, the Ward clustering on euclidean distances between mean signal scores transformed to the unit interval was chosen to cluster the Segway state labels. Subsequently, pairwise relationships between the ChromHMM and Segway merged states were identified using both overlap calculations and manual annotation (Hoffman, Ernst et al. 2013). Pairs of states that were viewed as concordant were placed assigned to one of the seven states classes. Regions of the genome occupied by concordant states between the two initial segmentations were were reassigned to the new summary labels. In some cases there were combinations of states between the two segmentations that could not be reconciled and these combinations were viewed as discordant. Regions with discordant states were not assigned a state label, and were dropped out of the summary combined segmentation.
