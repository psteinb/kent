<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows 38.2M single nucleotide variants (SNVs),
3.9M short insertion/deletion variants (indels),
and ~14,000 large deletions (also called structural variants, SVs)
discovered by the
<A HREF="http://1000genomes.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>1000 Genomes Project</A>
through its
Phase 1 sequencing of 1,092 genomes from 14 populations in Africa, Europe,
East Asia and the Americas.</P>
<P>
The variant genotypes have been phased by the 1000 Genomes Project,
i.e. the two alleles of each diploid genotype have been assigned to two
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype" TARGET=_BLANK>haplotypes</A>,
one inherited from each parent.
This extra information enables a clustering of independent haplotypes
by local similarity for display.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
<!-- An image with arrows & numbers sure would help here! and on the controls page -->
<!-- Also, this will apply to any VCF track w/phased genotypes, so probably should -->
<!-- be moved into an include file. -->
In &quot;dense&quot; mode a vertical line is drawn at the position of each
variant.
In &quot;pack&quot; mode, since these variants have been phased, the
display shows a clustering of haplotypes in the viewed range, sorted
by similarity of alleles weighted by proximity to a central variant.
The clustering view can highlight local patterns of linkage.</P>
<P>
In the clustering display, each sample's phased diploid genotype is split
into two independent haplotypes.
Each haplotype is placed in a horizontal row of pixels; when the number of
haplotypes exceeds the number of vertical pixels for the track, multiple
haplotypes fall in the same pixel row and pixels are averaged across haplotypes.</P>
<P>
Each variant is a vertical bar with black representing the reference allele
and white (invisible) representing the non-reference allele(s).
Tick marks are drawn at the top and bottom of each variant's vertical bar,
to make the bar more visible when most alleles are reference.
The vertical bar for the central variant used in clustering is outlined in purple.
In order to avoid long compute times, the range of alleles used in clustering
may be limited; alleles used in clustering have purple tickmarks at the
top and bottom.</P>
<P>
The clustering tree is displayed to the left of the main image.
It does not represent relatedness of individuals; it simply shows the arrangement
of local haplotypes by similarity.  When a rightmost branch is purple, it means
that all haplotypes in that branch are identical, at least within the range of
variants used in clustering.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions/deletions (indels), and
larger deletions (referred to as structural variants, SVs) were called from
alignments of 1,092 individuals' low-coverage genomes and high-coverage exomes.
For each type of variant, the results of multiple variant-calling methods 
were merged and filtered in order to provide high-confidence variant calls.
