<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Denisova Variants track shows variant calls made using
high-coverage sequence reads from an archaic Denisovan individual
mapped to the $organism genome reference assembly.
The Denisova DNA was extracted from a phalanx bone excavated from
Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A novel single-stranded DNA library preparation method (Meyer, 2012)
was applied to DNA previously extracted from 40mg of bone (Reich, 2010).
Using single-stranded DNA greatly increased the genomic coverage to
30X compared to an earlier 1.9X sequence (Reich, 2010).
Sequence reads were aligned to $organism sequence $date
(downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://1000genomes.org"
TARGET=_BLANK>1000 Genomes Project</A>) using the
<A HREF="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET=_blank>Burrows-Wheeler Aligner.</A>
Genotype calls for single nucleotide variants and small insertions and
deletions were made using the Unified Genotyper from the
<A HREF="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/"
TARGET=_BLANK>Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)</A>, with an additional iteration
using a modified reference genome in order to reduce reference bias
(Note 6,

TARGET=_BLANK>Comprehensive VCF files</A> that include information for homozygous-reference

to retain only those locations that clearly differ from the $organism reference genome.
Reference genome bases without variant calls may indicate either matching Denisova sequence
or insufficient data.
