<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
RNA (from a commercial source) from 11 tissues were hybridized to Affymetrix 
$Organism Exon 1.0 ST arrays. For each tissue, 3 replicate experiments were 
performed 
for a total of 33 arrays.  The raw intensity signal from the arrays
was normalized
with a quantile normalization method, then run through the PLIER algorithm.
The normalized data were then converted to median-centered log-ratios, 
which are displayed as green for negative log-ratios (below-median expression),
and red for positive (above-median expression).</P>

<P>The probe sets for this microarray track are shown in the 
the <B>Affy Exon Probes</B> track.</P>
