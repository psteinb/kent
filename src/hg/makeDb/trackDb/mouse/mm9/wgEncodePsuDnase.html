<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display
individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks
are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
This track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT>
<DD> DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) identified as signal peaks within
FDR 1.0% hypersensitive zones.</DD>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT>
<DD>The density of tags mapping within a 150 bp sliding window
(at a 20 bp step across the genome).</DD>
</DL>
<p>DNaseI sensitivity is shown as the absolute density of <EM>in vivo</EM>
cleavage sites across the genome mapped using the Digital DNaseI methodology
(see below).  Data have been normalized to 25 million reads per cell type.

<H2> Data Release Policy </H2>

<p>Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset until
nine months following the release of the dataset.  This date is listed in
the <EM>Restricted Until</EM> column, above.  The full data release policy
for ENCODE is available
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="../ENCODE/terms.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.</p>
