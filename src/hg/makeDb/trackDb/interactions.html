<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Pathways and Gene Interactions track shows a summary of gene interaction and pathway data
collected from two sources: curated pathway/protein-interaction databases and interactions found
through text mining of PubMed abstracts.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<h3>Track Display</h3>
<p>
The track features a single item for each gene loci in the genome. On the item itself, the gene
symbol for the loci is displayed followed by the top gene interactions noted by gene symbol and
followed by a number representing the amount of abstracts that support that interaction.
Clicking an item will take you a
<a href="../../goldenPath/help/hgGeneGraph.html">gene interaction graph</a>
that includes detailed information on the support for the various interactions.</p>

<h3>Pathway and Gene Interaction Display</h3>
<p>
See the <a href="../../goldenPath/help/hgGeneGraph.html#configure">help documentation</a>
accompanying this gene interaction graph for more information on its configuration.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The pathways and gene interactions were imported from a number of databases and mined from
millions of PubMed abstracts. More information can be found in the
&quot;<a href="../../goldenPath/help/hgGeneGraph.html#methods">Data Sources and Methods</a>&quot;
section of the help page for the gene interaction graph.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The underlying data for this track can be accessed interactively through the Table Browser or
Data Integrator. Data can also be programmatically accessed using the public MySQL server or can be
downloaded for offline processing from our downloads server. The tables (and files) associated with
this track are ............</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
The text-mined data for the gene interactions and pathways were generated by Chris Quirk and
Hoifung Poon as part of <a href="https://hanover.azurewebsites.net">Microsoft Research, Project
Hanover</a>.</p>

<p>
Pathway data was provided by the databases listed under 
&quot;<a href="../../goldenPath/help/hgGeneGraph.html#methods">Data Sources and Methods</a>&quot;
section of the help page for the gene interaction graph.
In particular, thank you to Ian Donaldson from IRef for his
unique collection of interaction databases.</p>

<p>
The short gene descriptions are a merge of the <a href="http://hprd.org">HPRD</a> and <a
href="http://pantherdb.org">PantherDB</a> gene/molecule classifications. Thanks to Arun Patil from
HPRD for making them available as a download.</p>

<p>
The track display and gene interaction graph
were developed at the UCSC Genome Browser by Max Haeussler.</p>
