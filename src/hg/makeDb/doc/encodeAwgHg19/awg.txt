# ENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG) tracks on hg19 
#
# Data in these tracks are generated by uniform processing pipelines that merge replicates
# and apply consistent analysis across different data production labs, so they are
# of greater interest to most users (and easier to use) than the ENCODE lab tracks.

# Uniform DNase peaks (2012-07-26 started, 2012-12-06 in progress kate)
#
# Note - this work started in conjunction with update of ENCODE Regulation super-track
# as it is needed for the DNase Clusters track.
#
# Bob Thurman at UW ENCODE (Stam lab) generated this data by running the UW HotSpot
# pipeline on UW and Duke datasets (aligned reads).  
# It is currently hosted on the ENCODE Analysis Hub.
# Note: DNase signal tracks from AWG are also available on the hub -- these
# were generated from aligned reads using the wiggler pipeline, 
# without any replicate or lab merging.
