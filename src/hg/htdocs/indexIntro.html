        	    Welcome to the UCSC Genome Browser website. 
		    This site contains the 
		    reference sequence and working draft
        	    assemblies for a large collection of genomes. It also 
        	    provides portals to the 
		    <A HREF="ENCODE/">ENCODE</A> and
		    <A HREF="Neandertal">Neandertal</A> projects.  </P>

        	    <P>
        	    We encourage you to explore these sequences with our tools.
        	    The 
		    <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=human">Genome 
		    Browser</A> zooms and scrolls over chromosomes, 
        	    showing the work of annotators worldwide. The 
		    <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgNear?org=human">Gene 
		    Sorter</A> 
        	    shows expression, homology and other information on groups 
        	    of genes that can be related in many ways.  
        	    <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgBlat?org=human">Blat</A> 
		    quickly maps your sequence to the genome.  The 
		    <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgTables?org=human">Table 
        	    Browser</A> provides convenient access to the underlying 
        	    database. 
		    <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgVisiGene?org=human">VisiGene</A> 
		    lets you browse through a large 
        	    collection of <em>in situ</em> mouse and frog images to
        	    examine expression patterns. 
		    <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgGenome?org=human">Genome 
		    Graphs</A> allows you to 
        	    upload and display genome-wide data sets.</P>
