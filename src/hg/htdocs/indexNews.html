           	<font face="courier" size="3"><b>16 July 2012 - Tasmanian Devil
		Assembly Now Available in Genome Browser </b></font>
                <p>We are pleased to announce the release of a Genome Browser 
		for the February 2011 Tasmanian devil assembly, <em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em> 
		(WTSI version Devil_refv7.0, UCSC version sarHar1). The Tasmanian devil, 
		which is native to the island of Tasmania, is at risk of extinction due 
		to a transmissible facial cancer. The devil population in Tasmania has declined by more 
		than 80% since the first time the disease was observed 14 years ago. 
		This draft assembly, created by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank"
		>Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>,
		was sequenced using Illumina reads. This completed genome is the first step
		towards finding genetic mutations in the transmissible cancer, which will help
		researchers understand the disease and its spread.				
		<p>
		Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available 
		via the Genome Browser 
		<a href="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sarHar1/"
		>FTP server</a> or the 
		<a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#tasmanian_devil"
		>Downloads</a> page. The Tasmanian devil browser 
		annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. 
		See the 
		<a href="/goldenPath/credits.html#tasmanian_devil_credits"
		>Credits</a> page for a detailed list of the organizations and 
		individuals who contributed to the success of this release.

                To Be Retired </B></FONT>
		</P>
		<P>We are announcing the imminent retirement of the hgText
                CGI.  hgText was the original version of the Table Browser,
                and was replaced by the new CGI, hgTables, in <A HREF = 
                "goldenPath/newsarch.html#100104">2004</A>. A very
                small number of our users are still accessing the database
                using the old hgText CGI.  Beginning July 24, 2012, we will
                be removing the hgText CGI from our site.  All users will need
                to use hgTables after that time.  </P>

                With the abundance of new vertebrate assemblies available in
                GenBank, the UCSC Genome Browser team has streamlined its
                browser release pipeline in the effort to keep pace.
