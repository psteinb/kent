		<font face="courier" size="3"><b>17 September 2012 -
Retiring the Proteome Browser </b></font>
		<p>
		We are announcing the imminent retirement of the Proteome Browser.
		We introduced the Proteome Browser in 2003 to provide access to
		protein-specific information independent of the genomic details
		presented in the Genome Browser. Since then we've incorporated more
		of this information in the UCSC Genes details page accessible from the
		Genome Browser, and in the columns of the Gene Sorter. Since very few
		people are still accessing the Proteome Browser, we've decided to
		retire it to focus our work on these other two tools. Access to the
		databases that supported the Proteome Browser (uniProt and proteome)
		will still be available through the Table Browser and our public MySQL
		server.

		<font face="courier" size="3"><b>16 August 2012 -
Announcing a Genome Browser for the Medium ground finch </b></font>
		<p>
		We have released a browser for the Medium ground finch, 
		<em>Geospiza fortis</em>, renowned as one of naturalist Charles
		Darwin's Galapagos finches. This species, which has been the 
		subject of many evolutionary studies, is one of a group of 
		birds that evolved over a few million years from a single 
		ancestral species into multiple species whose beak sizes and
		shapes are specialized for using different food resources. The 
		phenotypic diversity of these birds contributed to Darwin's 
		theory of evolution. The significance of this genome assembly is
		described in the August 16, 2012, 
		<a href="https://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article/1939" 
		target=_blank>press release</a> issued by the UCSC Center for 
		Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE).

		<font face="courier" size="3"><b>14 August 2012 - Changes to our website</b></font>
		<p>
		We are pleased to announce a few changes to the look and feel of the Genome
		Browser website. In addition to a new font throughout the site, the first thing you might notice is
		a new menu bar across the top of many of the pages. We have reorganized the navigation on our web
		applications with you in mind; we hope you find it more intuitive!
