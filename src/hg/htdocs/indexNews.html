        New UCSC Genes Track Released for GRCm38/mm10</b></font>
        <p>
        We're happy to announce the release of an updated UCSC Genes track for the GRCm38/mm10
        mouse Genome Browser. The new release has 63,244 total transcripts, compared with 61,642
        in the previous version. The total number of canonical genes has increased from 32,408
        to 32,958. Comparing the new gene set with the previous version:
        <ul>
          <li>59,119 transcripts did not change between versions.</li>
          <li>55 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
          <li>2,308 transcripts are &quot;compatible&quot; with those in the previous set, meaning
              that the two transcripts show consistent splicing.  In most cases, the old and new
              transcripts differ in the lengths of their UTRs.</li>
          <li>160 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent
              splicing (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        More details about the new UCSC Genes track can be found on the
        <a href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=knownGene">UCSC Genes track
        description page</a>.

        <p>
        Many thanks to Brian Raney and Matthew Speir for their work on this track!
