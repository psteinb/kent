        New Roadmap Epigenomics Integrative Analysis Hub now available</b>
        </font>
	</p>

	<p>
	We are pleased to announce the addition of the
	<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hubUrl=http://vizhub.wustl.edu/VizHub/RoadmapIntegrative.txt"
	>Roadmap Epigenomics Integrative Analysis Hub</a> to our list of publicly available track hubs.
	This new hub, produced by <a href="http://vizhub.wustl.edu/" target="blank">VizHub</a> at Washington
	University in St. Louis (WUSTL), contains hundreds of tracks that cover the wide range of epigenomic data
	available from the <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/" target='blank'>Roadmap Epigenomics
	Project</a>. This hub contains data from over 40 different assays carried out on over 250 different
	cell and sample types. These assays include RNA-seq, MeDIP-seq, MRE-seq, methylC-seq, DNase
	hypersensitivity, chromHMM segmentation, ChIP-seq, and more than 30 histone modifications. The data
	contained in this hub is complementary to the ENCODE data available at UCSC and in the ENCODE
	Integrative Analysis public hub.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can view more data produced by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project in their other publicly available
	track hub, the Roadmap Epigenomics Data Complete Collection. You can use these two hubs together
	to access all the available Roadmap Epigenomics Project data using the UCSC Genome Browser. To access
	and view these hubs, navigate to the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgHubConnect">Track Hub gateway page</a>
	and select both the Roadmap Epigenomics Integrative Analysis Hub and Roadmap Epigenomics Data
	Complete Collection Hub from the Public Hubs list.
	</p>

	<p>
	Any queries about the data should be directed to

        New UCSC Gene Track Released for GRCh38/hg38</b>
        </font>
        <p>
	We're happy to announce the release of a new UCSC Genes track for the 
	GRCh38/hg38 human Genome Browser.
	The new release has 104,178 transcripts, compared with 82,960 in the previous 
	version on hg19. The total number of canonical genes has increased from 
	31,848 to 48,424. Comparing the new gene set with the previous version:
	</p>

	<ul>
        <li>69,691 transcripts did not change between versions.</li>
        <li>619 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
        <li>8,879 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, 
	meaning that the two transcripts show consistent splicing.</li>
        <li>3,393 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
    	More details about the new UCSC Genes track can be found on the
	<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=knownGene" 
	>UCSC Genes track description page</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
    	Many thanks to Brian Raney, Jim Kent, and Luvina Guruvadoo 
	for their work on this track!
