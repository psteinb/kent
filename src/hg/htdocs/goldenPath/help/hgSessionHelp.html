<!-- ====Introduction======================== -->
<a name="Introduction"></a> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">Session</a> tool allows you to configure your 
browser with specific track combinations, including <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom 
tracks</a>, and save the configuration options. Multiple sessions may be saved for future reference,
for comparing different data sets, or for sharing with your colleagues. Saved sessions 
<A href="#Lifespan">will not be expired</a>, however, we still recommend that you keep local 
back-ups of your session contents and any associated custom tracks. <a href="#CTs">BLAT result 
tracks persist</a> for at least 48 hours after the last time they are viewed.</a> The creation date 
of a session can be viewed in the Session Management menu. This date only reflects the initial 
creation of the Session and is not updated when sessions are edited. Descriptive text can also be 
added to a session in the <A href="#Details">Session Details</a> menu.</p> 
<p>
This feature may be accessed via the <strong>Session</strong> link in the top blue navigation bar in
any assembly. To ensure privacy and security, you must <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" 
target="_blank">create an account</a> and <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">log 
in</a> before using the session manager.</p> 
<p>
Individual sessions may be designated as either <a href="#ShareOrNot"><em>shared</em> or 
<em>non-shared</em></a> to protect the privacy of confidential data. To avoid having a new shared 
session from someone else override your existing Genome Browser settings, you are encouraged to open
a new web-browser instance or to save existing settings in a session before 
<a href="#Open">loading</a> a new shared session.</p>
<p>
Note that not all of the Genome Browser <a href="../../mirror.html">mirror sites</a> have all of the
session features enabled.</p> 
<p>
This User's Guide provides a few examples that introduce the features of the Session tool, followed 
by detailed directions on creating, saving, modifying and sharing sessions.</p>

<!-- ====Example======================== -->
<a name="Example"></a>
<h2>Some simple examples</h2> 
<p>
This section contains some example sessions that demonstrate the use of the Session tool. To enable 
you to view these sessions, we have <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">created a user
account</a> with the name <em>Example</em>.  </P>

<!-- =====Example 1======================= -->
<a name="Example1"></a> 
<h3>Example 1</h3> 
<p>
This example shows the primate (chimp and rhesus) nets for chromosome 2 in the hg17 human assembly 
&mdash; the primate chromosome that fused in humans. We first configured our browser view with the 
desired settings, and then saved the session so that we could share it. We named our session 
<code>hg17_chr2_primate</code>.</p> 
<p>
There are several ways for you to view this session:</p> 
<uL> 
  <li>
  <strong>Manually load and open the session.</strong> Open the <A href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" 
  target="_blank">Session</a> tool. In the <code>Session Management</code> section under the 
  <em>Load Settings</em> heading, enter this information:</p>
<pre><code>user: Example
session name: hg17_chr2_primate </code></pre>
  <p> 
  Click the <code>submit</code> button next to the session name box to load the session. To view 
  the session in the Genome Browser, click the <code>Genome Browser</code> link in the top blue 
  navigation bar.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session link sent by email.</strong> After we created and saved this session, we 
  could have clicked the <em>Email</em> link to automatically send a message to one or more 
  recipients with the following contents and clickable link:</p>
  <pre><code>Here is a UCSC browser session I'd like to share with you: 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=Examples&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg17_chr2_primate"
target="_blank">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=Examples&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg17_chr2_primate</a></code>. </pre>
  <p>
  By clicking this link, you can open the session in your browser.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session from a local file.</strong> Alternatively, if we had saved the browser 
  settings to a local file, we could have simply provided the location of that file for you to load 
  into your browser to view our session. Click <A href="examples/session_example1.txt">here</a> to 
  see such a settings file. This method works best when the file is in a location that you can 
  access from your own computer or network. For this example, you can copy this file and paste it 
  into a file on your own machine, then load it into the Session tool.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session from a URL.</strong> Because you do not have access to our file system 
  where this session file resides, it will be easier for you to load it using a URL. To do this, 
  open the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">Session</a> tool. In the <code>Session 
  Management</code> section under the <em>Load Settings</em> header, enter the URL where this file 
  is located:</p> 
  <pre><code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/session_example1.txt</code></pre>
  <br>
  Then, click the <code>submit</code> button to load the session settings. To view the session in 
  the Genome Browser, press the <em>Browser</em> link in the <code>Updated Session</code> 
  section.</li> 
</ul>

<!-- =====Example 2======================= -->
<a name="Example2"></a> 
<h3>Example 2</h3> 
<p>
This example shows the Human Accelerated Region (HAR1) in the hg18 assembly. Eighteen differences 
exist in a region of 118 bases between human and all other mammals extending back to the chicken. 
The two sessions in this example show the same browser position at two levels of detail: Example 2a 
is zoomed out; Example 2b is zoomed in.</p> 
<p>
To view these sessions in your browser, you can use any of the methods described in Example 1:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Manually load and open the session.</strong><br>
  <em>Example 2a:</em>
  <pre><code><strong>user:</strong> Example
<strong>session name:</strong> hg18_HAR1</code></pre>
  <em>Example 2b:</em>
  <pre><code><strong>user:</strong> Example
<strong>session name:</strong> hg18_HAR1_zoom </code></pre></li>
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session link sent by email.</strong><br>
  <em>Example 2a:</em> 
  <pre><code><a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=Example&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg18_HAR1" 
  target="_blank">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&<br>hgS_otherUserName=Example&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg18_HAR1</a></code></pre>
  <em>Example 2b:</em> 
  <pre><code><a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=Example&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg18_HAR1_zoom" 
  target="_blank">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&<br>hgS_otherUserName=Example&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg18_HAR1_zoom</a>.</code></pre></li>
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session from a local file.</strong><br> 
  <em>Example 2a:</em> Copy the contents of this <a href="examples/session_example2a.txt">file</a> 
  to a file on your own machine, then load it into the Session tool.<br> 
  <em>Example 2b:</em> Copy the contents of this <a href="examples/session_example2b.txt">file</a> 
  to a file on your own machine, then load it into the Session tool.</li></br>
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session from a URL.</strong><br> 
  <em>Example 2a:</em> Paste this URL into the Session tool: 
  <pre><code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/session_example2a.txt</code></pre>
  <em>Example 2b:</em> Paste this URL into the Session tool: 
  <pre><code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/session_example2b.txt</code></pre> 
</ul>

<!-- === Creating a Session ================ -->
<a name="Create"></a>
<h2>Creating a session</h2> 
<p>
It is easy to create a session to save or share. Simply configure the Genome Browser as you wish, 
then navigate to the Session tool by clicking on the <strong>My Data</strong> pulldown in the top 
blue navigation bar. Follow these steps to save your session:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  <strong>Log in to the Genome Browser.</strong> To ensure privacy and security, you must 
  <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">create an account</a> and/or 
  <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">log in</a> to use the Session tool. You will not
  have to repeat the login step unless you sign off from the Session tool or close your Genome 
  Browser.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Create a named session.</strong> Scroll down to the <code>Save Settings</code> section of 
  the page. Type a name into the <code>Save current settings as named session</code> box. Choose 
  whether or not you would like to <a href="#Share">share</a> your sessions with others. If the 
  <code>allow this session to be loaded by others</code> box is checked, anyone will be able to view
  your Genome Browser settings (including your custom tracks) if you provide them with your user and
  session name. Note that your session is <em>not</em> automatically available to the general public
  if you choose this option: you must provide the user and session name to other individuals for 
  them to view it. This helps to ensure the confidentiality of your private data. After naming the 
  session and choosing your sharing option, click the <code>submit</code> button. Your session will 
  then be listed by name under <em>My Sessions</em>.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Save session settings to a file.</strong> Alternatively, you can create a file from your 
  session settings that can be saved to your local machine or posted to a URL for 
  <a href="#Open">access or sharing</a>. To do this, go to the <code>Save Settings</code> section.  
  Type a name into the <code>Save current settings to a local file</code> box. Click the 
  <code>submit</code> button to save or display the file. The session will be saved in plain text 
  (ascii) format by default. To select a compressed format, select one of the options from the 
  <code>file type returned</code> menu before clicking <code>submit</code>. If you simply wish to 
  preview the contents of the file in your browser window, leave the file name blank and click 
  <code>submit</code>.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>
Saved sessions <a href="#Lifespan">will not be expired</a>, and should persist until you 
<a href="#Delete">delete</a> them. However, it is still recommended that you keep local backups of 
your session contents and any associated custom tracks.</p>

<!-- =====Opening a Saved Session======================== -->
<a name="Create"></a>
<h2>Opening a saved session</h2> 
<p>
When you save a session, it is added to the <em>My Sessions</em> list on the Session page. Each 
session entry is listed by name and offers the following options to open, share, and manipulate it: 
<ul> 
  <li>
  <strong>Session name.</strong> Click the session name to view it in the Genome Browser.</li>  
  <li>
  <strong>View/edit details.</strong> Click the <code>details</code> button to edit the session
  description and view session details such as creation date/time, assemblies with custom tracks and
  more.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Delete the session.</strong> Click the <code>delete</code> button to permanently remove 
  this session from the list.</li>  
  <li>
  <strong>Share with others</strong>: Check this box to allow others to access this session. By 
  default, this option is unchecked, which limits access to only the session owner.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Post in public listing</strong>: Check this box to add your session to the list of 
  <a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgPublicSessions">Public Sessions</a>. Sessions in the listing will be 
  available to be loaded and viewed by the world.</li>  
  <li>
  <strong>Email.</strong> Click this link to <A href="#Share">email</a> this session to a 
  colleague.</li> 
</ul>

<!-- == Details ====================== -->
<a name="Details"></a>
<h2>Session details</h2>
<p>
Each session has an associated details page that you can click into from the 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">Session Management</a> menu. The Session Details 
menu allows you to edit the Session Name, to add descriptive text and to change whether or not the 
session is shared with others. Like the Session Management menu, if you click &quot;use&quot; that 
session will be loaded as the current session and if you click &quot;delete&quot; the session will 
be deleted. The &quot;Created on&quot; date reflects the date that the session was originally 
created and will not be updated to reflect any edits.</p>

<!-- ======Sharing a Session======================== -->
<a name="Share"></a>
<h2>Sharing a session</h2>

<!-- =====Shared vs. Non-shared Data======================= -->
<a name="ShareOrNot"></a>
<h3>Shared vs. non-shared data</h3> 
<p>
When you create a session using the Session tool, you may designate it as either <em>shared</em> or 
<em>non-shared</em>. By default, new sessions are created as shared and must be explicitly changed 
to non-shared status.</p> 
<p>
Shared sessions can be opened by other Genome Browser users to whom you've provided one of the 
following:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>
  the user name and session name of the saved session</li>
  <li>
  access privileges to a local file that contains the saved session information</li>
  <li>
  the URL of a web-accessible session settings file</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Sessions which you've added to the list of <a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgPublicSessions">Public 
Sessions</a> will available to the world. Note that unless you've added them to this list of Public 
Sessions, your shared sessions will not be available in a general way to other Genome Browser users;
they will need at least one of these access methods.</p> 
<p>
If you choose to keep your session private, other users of the Genome Browser will not be able to 
access your data or browser configuration. Any confidential data or locations of interest that you 
are working with will be safe from viewing by others.</p> 
<p>
The most secure way to control your session is to save the settings to a local file, then deny 
access to that file by others.</p>

<!-- =====Sharing a Session with Others======================= -->
<a name="HowToShare"></a>
<h3>Sharing your session with others</h3> 
<p>
There are five ways to let others know about your saved sessions: 
<ul> 
  <li>
  <strong>Save the session URL.</strong> Immediately upon saving a new session, the top of the page 
  offers a <code><strong>Browser</strong></code> hyperlink. Additionally, each session entry in the 
  <em>My Sessions</em> list has a <code>Browser</code> hyperlink. Click either <code>Browser</code>
  link to open the Genome Browser with the session loaded. You can obtain the URL of the Genome 
  Browser page by capturing the <code>Browser</code> hyperlink via right-click before you proceed 
  to the Browser graphical view. You can then store the URL, create a bookmark or share the link 
  with others.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Email a session link.</strong> Each session entry in the <em>My Sessions</em> list also 
  has an <code>Email</code> link. Click this link to automatically invoke your email tool with a 
  message containing the Genome Browser URL, which you can then send to others.</li>   
  <li>
  <strong>Share a session settings file.</strong> If you have saved your settings to a local file, 
  you can give others access to the file, or email the file to them as an attachment and instruct 
  them to load it using the Session tool.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Share a web URL.</strong> If you have saved your settings to a file on a web server, you 
  can provide a link like this to others: 
  <pre><code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgSession?hgS_doLoadUrl=submit&hgS_loadUrlName=<em>MyUrl</em></code></pre>
  <p> 
  where <code><em>MyUrl</em></code> is the URL of your settings file, e.g., 
  <code>http://www.mysite.edu/~me/mySession.txt</code>. In this type of link, you may replace 
  &quot;<code>hgSession</code>&quot; with &quot;<code>hgTracks</code>&quot; to proceed directly to 
  the Genome Browser.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>List it on the Public Sessions page.</strong> The 
  &quot;<a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgPublicSessions">Public Sessions</a>&quot; tool allows you to 
  post and share your exciting and interesting Browser snapshots with the world. After having saved 
  your session, you can add it to this public listing by checking the box in the column under 
  &quot;post in public listing?&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<!-- =====Opening a Shared Session======================= -->
<a name="Open"></a>
<h3>Opening a shared session</h3>
<p>
If you open a shared session while viewing the Genome Browser, it is possible to lose all of your 
own browser settings. That is, the settings for the newly-opened session will take precedence over 
your existing settings and will replace them. If you wish to preserve your original settings, you 
should first save your own settings as a session before opening a new session, or open a new tab or 
window in your internet browser before loading the new session.</p> 
<p>
There are four ways to open a shared session, depending on what information you have about the 
session. The instructions below assume that you want to replace your current session the new 
session. Be sure to preserve your original session first if you don't want to overwrite it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session from an email link.</strong> If you receive an email message with a link to
  a colleague's shared session, simply click on the link to view the Genome Browser with the session
  settings.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Open another user's session.</strong> If you know the name of another user's shared 
  session you can type in the user and session name in the &quot;Restore Settings&quot;
  section and click &quot;submit&quot; This will generate an &quot;Updated Session&quot; message and
  you can click on the Browser link to load the browser with the settings saved in this 
  session.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session from a settings file.</strong> Open the Session tool, then scroll down to 
  <em>Load Settings</em> in the <em>Session Management</em> section. Type in the name of the 
  settings file, or click <code>Browse...</code> to find the file on your computer. Click 
  <code>submit</code> to display the Genome Browser using these session settings.</li> 
  <li>
  <strong>Open a session specified by a URL.</strong> Open the Session tool, then scroll down to 
  <em>Load Settings</em> in the <em>Session Management</em> section. Type in the URL in the 
  <code>Load settings from a URL</code> box, then click <code>submit</code> to display the Genome 
  Browser using the new session settings. Note that you may also choose to save a copy of your 
  colleague's session as your own. Any changes you make to this newly saved session will not be seen
  by your colleague until you resave it and share it with them.</li>
</ul>

<!-- =====Editing an Existing Session======================== -->
<a name="Edit"></a>
<h2>Editing an existing session</h2> 
<p>
It's easy to make changes to an existing session. Reconfigure the Genome Browser as you wish, then 
resave the session with the same name. The Session tool will warn you that you are about to 
overwrite an existing session.</p> 
<p>
You can also edit any descriptive text associated with your session as well as whether or not the 
session can be shared in the <a href="#Details">Session Details</a> menu. Note that editing a 
session will not alter the creation date listed in the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" 
target="_blank">Session Management</a> menu.</p> 
<p>
If you previously shared this session with others, they will not see the changes until they 
<a href="#Open">reload</a> your newly-edited session.</p> 

<!-- =====Displaying Your Own Tracks in a Session======================== -->
<a name="CTs"></a>
<h2>Displaying your own tracks in a session</h2>
<p> 
In addition to displaying standard UCSC tracks in your session, you can also display the following 
user-generated tracks:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">Custom Tracks</a></li> 
  <li>
  <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#GenomeGraphs">Genome Graph</a> tracks</li> 
</ul> 
<p>
Before you create and save your session, be sure to upload your 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" target="_blank">Custom Track</a> or 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgGenome" target="_blank">Genome Graph</a> track. These user-generated tracks
associated with a saved session will not be expired. BLAT results always have a lifespan of 48 
hours, even if they are part of a session.</p> 

<!-- =====Deleting a Session======================== -->
<a name="Delete"></a>
<h2>Deleting a session</h2> 
<p>
In the <strong>Session Management</strong> section under <em>My Sessions</em>, press the 
<code>delete</code> button next to the session name you would like to delete. This will permanently 
delete all details of the session from the UCSC server. Any saved links to that session will no 
longer work.</p> 
<p>
No other user can delete your saved sessions, even if you have provided access to your sessions to 
them. Other users simply have a <em>copy</em> of your session.</p> 
<p>
Unlike most other browser preferences, the session settings are not saved in your Genome Browser 
&quot;cart&quot;. Therefore, if you choose to reset the Genome Browser, it will <em>not</em> delete 
your saved sessions.</p>

<!-- =====Lifespan of a Session======================== -->
<a name="Lifespan"></a>
<h2>Lifespan of a session</h2> 
<p> 
Your saved sessions will not be expired and will available you (and others if you 
<a href="#Share">share</a> them) until you <a href="#Delete">delete</a> them. We have discontinued 
our previous policy of removing saved sessions and associated custom track data after four months. 
However, note that the UCSC Genome Browser is not a data storage service; please keep a local backup
of your session contents and custom track data.</p>

<!-- =====Session Gallery======================== -->
<a name="Gallery"></a>
<h2>Session gallery</h2> 
<p> 
The <a href="sessions.html" target="_blank">Session Gallery</a> is a collection of track views that 
help highlight viewing different topics in the browser. The sessions in the Session Gallery were 
created in the browser and then saved to a local file, which was then uploaded to an online 
location. This allows creating a single link, such as 
http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doLoadUrl=submit&hgS_loadUrlName=U, where 
<strong>U</strong> is the URL of the session file, e.g., http://www.mysite.edu/~me/mySession.txt, 
enabling users to maintain external control of the content file for easy update.</p>
