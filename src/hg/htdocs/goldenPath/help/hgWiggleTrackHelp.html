<h1>Configuring graph-based tracks</h1> 
<p> 
Genome Browser graph-based tracks may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different 
aspects of the displayed information. Some track types, such as BAM tracks and certain gene tracks, 
offer dynamic calculation of items in the current window to display a density graph where the height
is proportional to the number of items mapped to each genomic position. The following information 
explains each of the available configuration options.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Overlay method</strong>: The default &quot;transparent&quot; setting displays the colored 
transparent graphs of multiple subtracks overlayed in the same vertical space. The 
&quot;solid&quot; setting displays the colored opaque graphs of multiple subtracks overlayed in 
the same vertical space.  The &quot;stacked&quot; setting displays each graph stacked on top of 
each other where the high point of the graph is the sum of all the values. The &quot;none&quot; 
setting displays each graph in its own vertical space. Note that not all graph-based tracks 
include this option.</p>
<p> 
<strong>Type of graph</strong>: The default &quot;Bar&quot; setting depicts the graph data using 
color-filled bars. To view the data as a series of points or lines, select the 
&quot;Points&quot; setting.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Track height</strong>: To change the default display height of the graph in pixels, type 
in a value from within the indicated range.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Vertical viewing range</strong>: The min and max values specify the vertical portion of 
the graph that is displayed (default range is 30-70). These numbers can be used to set data 
threshold indicators. For example, to display only those GC values greater than 50 percent, set 
the min value to &quot;50&quot;.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Data view scaling</strong>: The default &quot;Use vertical viewing range setting&quot; 
option displays the data using the parameters specified in the Vertical viewing range setting. To 
configure the graph to automatically scale to a range defined by the minimum and maximum data 
points in the current view, select the &quot;Auto-scale to data view&quot; option. To keep the 
y=0 value in view at all times when Auto-scale is selected, set &quot;Always include 
zero&quot; to &quot;ON&quot;.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Transform function</strong>: Transforms the data points by the function selected in the 
drop-down menu. Usually the default setting is &quot;None&quot;.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Windowing function</strong>: When a  view is too large to show individual data values, the
values must be combined to produce a plot point. This option specifies the combining function to 
be used (default is &quot;Mean&quot;):</p> 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  &quot;Mean+whiskers&quot; - displays the mean in a dark shade, one standard deviation around the
  mean in a medium shade, and the maximum/minimum in a light shade. For bar graphs only the mean, 
  the mean plus a standard deviation, and the max are visible. This mode is not available if the 
  Overlay method is stacked.</li>  
  <li> 
  &quot;Maximum&quot; - displays the maximum value of all the points to be combined</li> 
  <li> 
  &quot;Mean&quot; - displays the mean</li> 
  <li> 
  &quot;Minimum&quot; - displays the minimum of all the points to be combined</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
<strong>Smoothing window</strong>: When set to a numerical value, this option determines the size,
in pixels, of a smoothing window to be passed over the plot to smooth the edges of the bars or 
lines. This is equivalent to a trend line calculation on the graph. The default setting is 
&quot;OFF&quot;.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Negate values</strong>: When checked, all values in the wiggle are negated, meaning that 
positive values become negative and vice-versa. This is useful for wiggles representing 
transcription or other activities on the Crick strand. Be aware that wiggles with negative values
are drawn in <strong>altColor</strong>  not <strong>color</strong> as positive values
e.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Draw indicator lines</strong>:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  <strong>at y=0.0</strong>: Select the &quot;ON&quot; setting to display a line marking the 0.0 
  position on the graph (default is &quot;OFF&quot;).</li> 
  <li> 
  <strong>at y= </strong>: Select the  &quot;ON&quot; setting to display a line on the graph at 
  the specified numerical value (defaults are &quot;0&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;). This line can be
   used to mark a significant threshold on the graph.</li> 
</ul>
