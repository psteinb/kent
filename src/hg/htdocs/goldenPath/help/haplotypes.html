<div id='haplotypes'> <!-- Allows using same CSS as the haplotypes aplet itself  -->
<P>
With the availability <A HREF='http://www.1000genomes.org/' TARGET=_BLANK>1000 Genomes</A> Phase 1
data, there are currently 1092 sets of variations phased across chromosomes.  Using these data, 
we can now see the actual haplotypes, or sets of variations, falling within the boundaries of 
protein coding exons as they are seen in healthy adult individuals.  For any given gene there 
can be no more than 2184 distinct haplotypes (a.k.a alleles) given the data, though in most
cases there are dramatically fewer (mean 4).  Many haplotypes will have little or no phenotypic
effect, being defined by synonymous SNPs or resulting in amino acid substitutions of little
consequence to the overall efficacy of the protein.  It is expected, however, that many haplotypes
will result in significant variation within humans.  Haplotypes associated with disease may
show evidence of negative selection, just as haplotypes associated with the immune system may 
show striking evidence for positive selection.  Occasionally the skew in a haplotype's 
distribution among populations will give hints to its anthropological history.   However, 
the vast majority of common haplotypes are represented in all major population groups, which 
may speak both to the age of individual haplotypes and the ongoing mixing of the human gene pool.  
</P> 

<H2>How to use the &quot;Gene Haplotype Alleles&quot; section</H2>

<P> 
Click on any protein-coding gene in the UCSC Genes track and scroll to the <B>Common Gene 
Haplotype Alleles</B> section. (The feature is currently implemented only on GRCh37/hg19 
protein-coding genes.)  There will be a table of haplotypes for the protein-coding 
portion of the gene.  The table is sortable on any column by clicking on the column headers.
</P> 

<UL>
<li>If the gene is on the negative ('-' or &quot;antisense&quot;) strand, all varaints and sequences 
    will be presented with respect to the negative strand.  Note that individual variants displayed 
    in the 1000 Genomes phase 1 variations track are all shown as they appear on the 
    positive ('+' or &quot;sense&quot;) strand.</li>

<li>Each haplotype is found in one or more subjects participating in phase 1 of the 
    1000 Genomes project.  The distribution of the haplotypes across different population 
    groups can be examined by pressing 
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Show populations'
    title='Show/Hide haplotype distribution across population groups' onclick='return false;'>. 
    Press
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='1000 Genome groups' 
    title='Show haplotype distribution across 1000 Genome population groups' 
    onclick='return false;'> 
    to display the distribution across a broader spectrum of groups (defined below).  
    Press 
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Major groups' 
    title='Show haplotype distribution across major population groups' 
    onclick='return false;'> 
    to return to the major grouping and 
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Hide populations' 
    title='Show/Hide haplotype distribution across population groups' onclick='return false;'> 
    to hide these data again.</li>

<li>By default, only non-synonymous, common variants are displyed. Common variants occur in at 
    least 1&#37; of 1000 Genomes subject chromosomes. Pressing 
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Include all variants' 
    title='Include or Restrict to non-synonymous, common variants with a frequency of at least 1%' 
    onclick='return false;'> 
    will replace the list of haplotypes by the list of <em>all</em> haplotypes found in 
    1000 Genomes subjects, though many of these haplotypes may have little or no protein-coding
    effect.  To return to haplotypes defined by common and non-synonmous variation, 
    press
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Common variants only' 
    title='Include or Restrict to non-synonymous, common variants with a frequency of at least 1%' 
    onclick='return false;'>. 
    <em class='textInfo'>Note that haplotype and homozygous frequency calculations depend 
    upon which variants are included.</em></li>
    
<li>Haplotype frequencies are based upon all relevant chromosomes in the data set.  The total
    number is almost always 2,184 (1,092 for Y and location-dependent for X).  Hover over
    the frequency calculations to show the number of a particular haplotype in the dataset 
    (<em>e.g.</em>, <span title='N=1327 of 2184'>"N=1327 of 2184"</span>).  
    If appropriate, the homozygous frequency will also be shown and will reflect the number 
    of individuals in the dataset.</li>  

<li>There may be no <em>reference haplotype</em> (made of entirely reference variants) 
    represented in the 1000 Genomes data. If there is, it will be marked as &quot;reference&quot; 
    in the table of haplotypes.</li>

<li>By default, all variants are displayed as their predicted effect on amino acid sequence.  
    Press <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Display as DNA bases'
    to view the variants as DNA bases instead.
    title='Display variants and sequence as amino acids or DNA bases' onclick='return false;'>.
    Return to the protein sequence view by pressing 
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Display as amino acids' 
    title='Display variants and sequence as amino acids or DNA bases' onclick='return false;'>.
    The reference variant is shown at the top of each variant column.  This is the value found
    in the GRCh37/hg19 reference genome.  In most cases it is a single letter (AA code/DNA base).
    In the case of an insertion with respect to the reference genome, the reference value
    will be seen as '-' .  Large deletions will be represented by the first two sequence 
    letters followed by &quot;+++&quot;.  Note that hovering the pointer over any of these variants 
    will show a more complete description (example: 
    <span title='AA:16 A|T chr9:136137554 SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005) rs55917063'>
    'AA:16 A|T chr9:136137554 SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005) rs55917063'</span>).
    The description includes the AA residue number and varaints (AA view only), genome location,
    base level variants and the dbSNP variant name if one is known.  Clicking on any 
    <em class='textOpt'>non-reference</em> variant shown in the variants section of the table 
    will link to the full details of that varaint as seen in the 1000 Genomes phase 1 track.</li>

<li>When the full sequence is displayed, columns with variants are highlighted by 
    <span style='background-color:#CCFFAA;'>green vertical lines</span>. The effects of variants are 
    highlighted by <B class='textAlert'>bold red letters</B>.  Synonymous changes are only 
    evident when DNA bases are displayed. Each haplotype allele sequence is generated from 
    GRCh37/hg19 reference DNA, with variants spliced in, then translated into amino acids.  
    Note that sorting on a variant column will highlight that one variant with a 
    <span style='background-color:#CCFFFF;'>blue vertical line</span> 
    in blue in the full sequence.  This can be used to quickly locate one variant out of many.
    In AA view, the AA residue is shown when hovering over any part of the sequence.</li> 

<li>By default, only common haplotype alleles are displayed. Common haplotypes occur in at 
    least 1&#37; of 1000 Genomes subject chromosomes.  Press
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Show rare haplotypes' 
    title='Show/Hide rare haplotypes that occur with a frequency of less than 1%' 
    onclick='return false;'>     
    to see all haplotypes and then press 
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Hide rare haplotypes' 
    title='Show/Hide rare haplotypes that occur with a frequency of less than 1%' 
    onclick='return false;'>     
    to hide the rare ones again.</li> 
    
<li>By default, scoring is hidden. Three types of scores are provided to help users find 
    haplotype alleles that occur more or less frequently than expected or that have unusual 
    distributions in populations. See definitions below.  To see the calculated scores, press
    <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Show scoring' 
    title='Show/Hide all haploptye scores' onclick='return false;'>.  
    <span class='textInfo'>Note that scores alone cannot be used to draw definitive 
    conclusions about any haplotype.</span></li>

<h2>Scoring definitions</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Hap score</dt>
<dd>The &quot;haplotype score&quot; is the normalized (-log10) probability of finding exactly 
    N subject chromosomes with this haplotype, given the proportions of individual variants. 
    The score is normalized by dividing by the total number of variants. Normalization allows 
    comparing the scores between genes with many variants and those with few. The score will 
    be positive if the haplotype is more frequent than expected by chance and negative if 
    less frequent.  For haplotyes made from common, non-synonymous varaints, haplotype scores 
    above 618 are seen in only 2&#37; of genes.  Likewise, a score of less than -205 is only seen 
    in 2&#37; of genes.</dd> 

<dt>Hom score</dt>
<dd>The &quot;homozygous score&quot; is the (-log10) probability of finding exactly N individuals 
    with this haplotype on both chromosomes, given the actual frequency of the haplotype in 
    subject chromosomes. The score will be positive if the haplotype is found homozygous in 
    more individuals than expected and negative when found in fewer individuals than expected.
    Negative values might suggest that the haplotype is deleterious when homozygous.  For 
    haplotyes made from common, non-synonymous varaints, homozygous scores above 96 are seen 
    in only 2&#37; of genes.  Likewise, a score of less than -17 is only seen in 2&#37; 
    of genes.</dd> 

<dt>Pop score</dt>
<dd>(only visible when population distributions are displayed) The &quot;population score&quot; 
    is the variance between population groups divided N, the number occurrences of the haplotype. 
    The most frequently occurring haplotypes will potentially have larger scores, but if N is 
    small, a skew in population distribution is not unexpected.  Polulation scores are always 
    greater than or equal to zero.  For haplotyes made from common, non-synonymous varaints, 
    population scores at or above 33.4 are seen in only 2&#37; of genes and scores above 38.4 are 
    seen in only 1&#37; of genes.</dd>
