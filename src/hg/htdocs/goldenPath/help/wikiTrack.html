<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The Wiki track displays genome annotations added by the Genome Browser user 
community. These annotations have <b><em>not</em></b> been curated.
</p>

<p>
As of June 2012, this track is a read-only track. Annotations are still
available and viewable in the track and all annotations can be viewed at the
<a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Category:Genome_Annotation" target="_blank">
Genome Annotation</a> wiki page, but no new annotations are being accepted and
existing annotations can no longer be freely edited.
</p>
