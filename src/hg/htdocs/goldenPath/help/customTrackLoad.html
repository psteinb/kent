<P>
An annotation data file in one of the supported custom track
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#format"
TARGET=_blank>formats</A> 
may be uploaded by any of the following methods:
<UL>
<LI>
(<em>Preferred</em>) Enter one or more 
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#ADD_CT"
TARGET=_blank>URLs</A>
for custom tracks (one per line) in the data text box.
The Genome Browser supports both the HTTP and FTP (passive-only) protocols.
<LI>
Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button directly above the URL/data text box, then
choose a custom track file from your local computer, or type the pathname of the
file into the &quot;upload&quot; text box adjacent to the &quot;Browse&quot;
button. The custom track data may be compressed by any of the following 
programs: gzip (<em>.gz</em>), compress (<em>.Z</em>), or bzip2 (<em>.bz2</em>).
Files containing compressed data must include the appropriate suffix in their 
names. 
<LI>
Paste the custom annotation text directly into the URL/data text box.
<LI>
Data provided by a URL may need to be proceeded by a separate line defining
 <A HREF="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#TRACK">type=<<I>track_type</I>></A> required for some tracks,
for example such as &quot;track type=broadPeak&quot;.
</UL></P>
<P>
If a login and password is required to access data loaded through
a URL, this information can be included in the URL using the format
<em>protocol://user:password@server.com/somepath</em>. Only Basic
Authentication is supported for HTTP. 
Note that passwords included in URLs are <B>not</B> protected. 
If a password contains a non-alphanumeric character, such as
&#36;, the character must be replaced by the hexidecimal
representation for that character. For example, in the password
<em>mypwd&#36;wk</em>, the &#36; character should be replaced by
%24, resulting in the modified password <em>mypwd%24wk</em>.
