<p>
The Annotation Integrator finds items in different tracks that overlap by position,
and unlike the Table Browser's intersection function, the Annotation Integrator can
output all fields from all selected tracks.  Up to 5 different tracks may be queried at a time.
</p>
<p>
This section contains a brief overview of Annotation Integrator controls.  For more
information on using the tools, see the
  <a HREF="">Annotation Integrator User's Guide</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Select Genome Assembly and Region</b><br />
The controls in this section are for selecting a genome assembly and region to search.
<ul>
  <li><b>group</b>: A species group: Mammal, Vertebrate, Insect etc.
  <li><b>genome</b>: A single species such as Human or Mouse.
  <li><b>assembly</b>: A version of the reference genome assembly such as GRCh37/hg19.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Configure Data Sources</b><br />
Currently selected data sources (tracks, custom tracks, hub tracks etc) are listed with
<!-- <span><i class="fa fa-arrows-v" /></span>  -->
icons for reordering the data sources.
The first data source is special in that data from the remaining data sources appear
only when they overlap with the first data source.
Under &quot;<b>Add Data Source</b>&quot;, several menus display available data sources:
<ul>
  <li><b>track group</b>: A category of data track, for example
    &quot;Genes and Gene Prediction&quot; or &quot;Regulation&quot;. </li>
  <li><b>track</b>: One or more data tables containing results of an experiment
    or a group of closely related experiments. </li>
  <li><b>table</b>: This appears only when the selected track has more than one data table. </li>
</ul>
These sections can be reordered by dragging on the section title or arrow icon on the left.
To remove a section, click the X icon to the right of the title.
Click on the Add button to add a new data source.
</p>

<p><b>Output Options</b><br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Send output to file</b>: check this box to have output sent to a local file
    instead of to the web browser window.
    <br /> When this is checked, additional options appear:
    <ul>
      <li><b>name:</b> the file name to which output will be saved</li>
      <li><b>compress with gzip</b>: check this box to have the output file compressed
	by gzip (.gz).
	This saves disk space and may reduce network transfer time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Choose fields</b>: click this button to pop up a dialog box with a checkbox
    for each field of each data source.  If a checkbox is checked, that field will
    appear in the output.
</ul>
