		<P>
		The Table Browser provides a powerful and flexible graphical
		interface for querying and manipulating the Genome Browser 
		annotation tables. Because the Table Browser uses the same 
		database as the Genome Browser, the two views are always 
		consistent.  
		<P>
		Using the Table Browser, you can: 
		<UL>
		<LI>
		retrieve the DNA sequence data or annotation data underlying 
		Genome Browser tracks for the entire genome, a specified 
		coordinate range, or a set of accessions
		<LI>
		apply a filter to set constraints on field values included in 
		the output
		<LI>
		generate a 
		<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom
		track</A> and automatically add it to your session so that it 
		can be graphically displayed in the Genome Browser
		<LI>
		conduct both structured and free-from SQL queries on the data
		<LI>
		combine queries on multiple tables or custom tracks through an 
		intersection or union and generate a single set of output data 
		<LI>
		display basic statistics calculated over a selected data set 
		<LI>
		display the schema for table and list all other tables in 
		the database connected to the table
		<LI>
		organize the output data into several different formats for use
		in other applications, spreadsheets, or databases
		</UL>
		<P>
		This User's Guide is aimed at both the novice Table Browser user
		as well the advanced user. If you are new to the Table Browser,
		read the <A HREF="#GettingStarted">Getting started</A> section to learn about browser basics
		and try some simple queries. Advanced users may want to proceed
		directly to the section that addresses a particular 
		area of functionality in detail.
	        <P>
		Although the Table Browser provides sufficient flexibility to 
		satisfy the needs of most users, some advanced users may require
		the ability to run MySQL directly on the Genome Browser database.
		UCSC provides a public MySQL server at 
		<FONT color="#0000FF">genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu</FONT>.
		Alternatively, the database may be downloaded to a local computer
		for MySQL access. See the 
		<A HREF="../../admin/mirror.html">mirror site</A>

		<P>
		The Table Browser is built on top of the Genome Browser 
		database</A>, which actually consists of several separate 
		databases, one for each genome assembly.  
		<P>
		Tables within the databases may be differentiated by whether the
		data are based on genome start-stop coordinates 
		(positional tables) or are independent of position
		(non-positional tables). 
		Some output formats and query options are applicable only to 
		positional tables, hence the distinction.
		<P>

<!-- ====Non-positional======================= -->
<A NAME="NonPositional"></A>
	        <HR>
	        <B><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000FF">Non-positional tables</FONT></B>
		<P>
		Non-positional tables contain data not tied to genomic 
		location, for example a table that correlates a Known Gene 
		ID with a RefSeq accession ID. Some non-positional tables relate 
		internal numeric mRNA IDs to extended information such as author, 
		tissue, or keyword.  Some &quot;meta&quot; tables in this category
		contain information about the structure of the database itself 
		or describe external files containing sequence data.  
	        <P>
<!-- ====Positional========================== -->
<A NAME="Positional"></A>
	        <HR>
	        <B><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000FF">Positional tables</FONT></B>
	        <P>
		Positional tables contain data associated with specific 
		locations in the genome, such as mRNA alignments, gene 
		predictions, cross-species alignments, and other annotations.
     		Each of the annotation tracks displayed in the Genome Browser
		is based on a positional table. In some instances, data from
		other positional and non-positional tables may also be 
		incorporated into the track. Data associated with custom 
		annotation tracks active within the user's Table Browser session
		are also available as positional tables.
		<P>
		Positional tables can be further subdivided into several 
		categories based on the type of data they describe. Alignment
		data can be best described by using a block structure to represent
		each element. Other tables require only start and end 
		coordinate data for each element. Some tables specify a 
		translation start and end in addition to the transcription start 
		and end. Some tables contain strand information, others don't.  
		Most tables, but not all, specify a name for each element.  
		Based on the format of the data described by a table, different 
		query and output formatting options may be offered.  
		<P>
		For descriptions of the Genome Browser database tables, 
		see the <A HREF="/goldenPath/gbdDescriptions.html">annotation 
		database</A> documentation.

		In its most basic form, the Table Browser can be used to 
		retrieve a specific subset of records from a track or positional
		table in a selected genome assembly. The query may be based on
	        a specific position or a set of one or more identifiers.
	        <P>
	        This section describes the steps required to conduct basic
	        simple data queries using the Table Browser. Once you have
	        mastered the basic Table Browser functionality, refer to 
	        subsequent sections for information about generating more 
	        complex queries that use filters, intersections, and alternative 
	        data output formats.
	 	<P>

<!-- ====Position-based query================ -->
<A NAME="PositionQuery"></A>
	 	<HR>
	        <B><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000FF">Simple position-based query</FONT></B>
		<P>
		Follow these steps to display a list of records that lie
		within a specific position in a table:
		<P>
		<B>Step 1. Pick a genome assembly</B><BR>
		Specify the genome assembly from which you'd like to retrieve the
		data by choosing the appropriate organism in the <TT><B>genome</B></TT>
		list, then selecting the assembly version from the 
		<TT><B>assembly</B></TT> list. Note that the <TT><B>assembly</B></TT> list 
		refreshes each time a different option is selected in the 
		<TT><B>genome</B></TT> list. Assemblies are typically named after the first three
                characters of an organism's genus and species names.
		<P>
		<B>Step 2. Pick an annotation track</B><BR>
		The <TT><B>group</B></TT> list shows all the annotation track groups 
		available in the selected genome assembly. The names correspond
		to the groupings displayed at the bottom of the Genome Browser
		annotation tracks page. When a group is selected from the list,
		the <TT><B>track</B></TT> list automatically updates to show all the 
		annotation tracks available within that group. 
		  <UL>
		  <LI>
		  If you already know the name of the annotation track in which 
		  you're interested, select the <em>All Tracks</em> option in the 
		  <TT><B>group</B></TT> list, then select the track from the 
		  <TT><B>track</B></TT> list.
		  Similarly, you can directly select a table by 
		  choosing the <em>All Tables</em> option in the 
		  <TT><B>group</B></TT> list, selecting a database from the 
		  <TT><B>database</B></TT> list, then selecting the table from 
		  the <TT><B>table</B></TT> list.
		  <LI>
		  To examine all the tracks available within a certain group (e.g.
		  all gene prediction tracks), select the group name from the
		  <TT><B>group</B></TT> list, then browse the entries in the 
		  <TT><B>track</B></TT> list.
		  <LI>
		  Custom annotation tracks created during the current session
		  are listed under the <em>Custom Tracks</em> group.
		  <LI>
		  If no selections are made from the <TT><B>group</B></TT> or 
		  <TT><B>track</B></TT> lists, the track selection defaults to the
		  <em>Known Genes</em> track in the <em>Genes and Gene Prediction Tracks</em> group.
		  </UL>
		<P>
		<B>Step 3. Pick a table</B><BR>
		The <TT><B>table</B></TT> list shows all tables (both positional
		and non-positional) associated
		with the currently-selected track. By default, it 
		displays the primary table for the track, i.e. the table
		containing the data shown in the Genome Browser
		annotation track. Other tables in the list are linked to the
		primary table by a common field and may provide supporting
		data used in constructing the annotation. 
		<UL>
		<LI>
		If the <TT><B>group</B></TT> list is set to the 
		<em>All Tables</em> option, the tables list will show all tables
		present in the database currently selected in the 
		<TT><B>database</B></TT> list, rather than those associated with
		a particular track.  
		</UL>
		<P>
		<B>Step 4. Pick a genomic region</B> (positional tables only)<BR>
		By default, the Table Browser region is set to <TT><B>genome</B></TT>,
		which will display all the data records in the selected table. 
		  <UL>
		  <LI>
		  To restrict the data to a specific position
		  range, type the position into the <TT><B>position</B></TT> box. Some
		  examples of specific positions include a chromosome name 
		  (<em>chrX</em>), a coordinate range within a chromosome
		  (<em>chrX:100000-400000</em>), or a scaffold name.
		  <li>
		  You can select multiple genomic regions by clicking the "define regions" button and
		  entering up to 1,000 regions in a 3- or 4-field <a 
		  href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED</a> file format.
		  <LI>
		  To look up the position range of a genomic element -- such
		  as a gene name, an accession ID, an STS marker, etc. -- or 
		  keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA,
		  type the string into the <TT><B>position</B></TT> box, then 
		  click the <TT><B>Lookup</B></TT> button.
		  <LI>
		  The data in non-positional tables are not tied to genomic
		  coordinates; therefore, the <TT><B>region</B></TT> option is
		  unavailable when a non-positional table is selected. A basic 
		  query on a non-positional table will show all the data in the 
		  table.
		  </UL>
		<P>
		<B>Step 5. Display the output</B><BR>
		Click the <TT><B>Get Output</B></TT> button to display the 
		results of the query. By default, the Table Browser outputs the 
		data from all fields in the selected table as tab-separated text
		on the screen. See the <A HREF="#OutputFormats">Output Formats</A>
		section for information on configuring the query output.
		</OL>
		<P>
		<em><B>Example:</B></em><BR>
		Here is an example of a simple query that retrieves all the
		RefSeq Genes records in the position range 
		chr7:26906938-26940301 on the May 2004 human genome assembly.
		<OL>
		<LI>
		Select the <em>Human</em> option in the <TT><B>genome</B></TT> list
		<LI>
		Select the <em>May 2004</em> option in the <TT><B>assembly</B></TT> list
		<LI>
		Select the <em>Genes and Gene Prediction Tracks</em> option in the
		<TT><B>group</B></TT> list.
		<LI>
		Select the <em>RefSeq Genes</em> option in the
		<TT><B>track</B></TT> list.
		<LI>
		Type <em>chr7:26906938-26940301</em> in the 
		<TT><B>position</B></TT> box (the Table Browser will 
		automatically select the <TT><B>position</B></TT> option button).
		<LI>
		Click the <TT><B>Get Output</B></TT> button.
		</OL>
		<P>
		The Table Browser will display the records for the RefSeq
		accessions NM_005522, NM_153620, NM_006735, NM_153632, NM_030661,
		and NM_153631.

		<P>
		In many cases, you may want to retrieve data based on a list of 
		one or more accessions or names, rather than querying by
		genomic position. Many tracks in the Table Browser, such as
		those in the <em>Genes and Gene Prediction</em> track group, 
		support identifier queries. The identifier type used in the
		query must match the kind of identifiers present in the track data, e.g.
		mRNA accession IDs must be used to query the mRNA table.
		<P>
		Follow these steps to display a list of 
		records that correspond to a set of accessions or names entered 
		as query input.
		<P>
		<B>Step 1. Pick the genome assembly, track, and table</B>

	      <LI>
	      <em>feature-by-feature</em> comparisons preserve the structure of 
	      the primary table. For example, if the primary 
	      table describes exon structure and the features are compared
	      with a second table, the results will describe exon structure 
	      (unless you choose an output format in which the structure is 
	      lost). 
	      <LI>
	      <em>base-by-base</em> comparisons examine 
	      the primary table and the table underlying the secondary track one 
	      base at a time. The structure 
	      of the primary table is not preserved in this comparison. For 
	      example, even if the primary table describes 
	      exon structure, the intersection results will contain only position 
	      ranges; no information about exon/block structure, strand, or 
	      translation region will be retained.

	      set of positions
	      covered by one or both tables. For example, if you choose to 
	      complement the primary track, any position covered by the that

	      Some comparisons preserve the primary table's gene and alignment 
	      structure, if it exists. For example, if the <em>refGene</em>
	      table (human <em>RefSeq Genes</em> track) is combined with another
	      table  using one of these comparisons, the resulting output data
	      will describe exon structure (unless you choose an output format

	      or discarded based on the amount of positional overlap with 
	      the features in the table underlying the secondary track. The 
	      Table Browser offers the following options in this category:
	      <UL>
	      <LI>
	      <B>Any overlap:</B> A primary table record will appear in the 
	      output if any of its base positions are covered by any

	      <B>No overlap:</B> A primary table record will appear in the 
	      output only if none of its base positions are covered by any 
	      feature in the secondary table. 
	      <LI>
	      <B>Overlap greater than a specified threshold:</B> A primary table 
	      record will appear in the output if the percentage of its

	      the user-specified threshold. 
	      <P>
	      <LI>
	      <B>Overlap less a specified threshold:</B> A primary table record 
	      will appear in the output if the percentage of its base positions

	      threshold. 
	      </UL>

	      <B>Base-by-base comparisons</B><BR>
	      In these combination options, the positions of the primary 
	      and secondary table features are compared one base position at a 
	      time. When applying base-by-base comparisons, the structure of the 
	      primary table is not preserved. For example, if the <em>refGene</em>
	      table (from the human <em>RefSeq Genes</em> track) is compared with
	      a secondary table using these comparisons, the resulting output
	      data will not describe exon structure. Instead, only position 
	      ranges will be returned; the exon/block structure, strand, and
	      translation region information will be discarded. The Table Browser
	      provides the following base-by-base combination options:
	      <UL>
	      <LI>
	      <B>Base-by-base intersection (AND):</B> A nucleotide position 
	      is included in the output if it is covered by at least one feature 
	      of both the primary table <em>and</em> the secondary table.
	      <LI>
	      <B>Base-by-base union (OR):</B> A nucleotide position is 
	      included in the output if it is covered by at least one feature of 
	      either the primary table <em>or</em> the secondary table. 
	      </UL>
	      <P>
	      <P><B>Note:</B> If the primary table has an exon/block structure, 
	      only base positions located in exons and/or blocks will be counted. 
	      <P>
	      <B>Base-by-base complement (NOT)</B><BR>
              Before the Table Browser applies a feature-by-feature or 
	      base-by-base comparison to the table data, the set of positions 
	      covered by one or both tables can be inverted (complemented). When 
	      the data set of a table is complemented, any position 
	      covered by the table's features in the original data will be 
	      considered not covered in the inverted data, and vice versa.

          The CDS FASTA alignments are created from a Multiple Alignment File
          (<A HREF="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format5">MAF</A>) in
          combination with a 
          <A HREF="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format9">genePred</A> table.  
          The UCSC MAF format stores 
          multiple alignments at the DNA level between entire genomes. You can
          use the Table Browser to return FASTA alignments of coding regions in
          nucleotide-space or translated into
          amino acid-space.  However, it is worth noting that the initial
          MAF files are all created by aligning genomes at the DNA level.

	  <B>Genome-wide CDS FASTA alignments</B><BR>
          Note that when using
          the Table Browser to fetch CDS FASTA output, it is best to 
          restrict your query to a reasonable-sized position range rather than 
          requesting output from the entire genome.  A genome-wide
          query will take a substantial amount of compute time, and it is
          likely that your Internet browser will time out and disconnect.
          If you would like to download genome-wide CDS FASTA output 
          for any of several model organisms, you can do so from the 
          <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu">download server</A>.

	  <P>
          <B>Creating CDS FASTA alignments using the Table Browser</B><BR>
          To display FASTA multiple alignments for the CDS regions of genes,
          select the <em>CDS FASTA alignment from multiple alignment</em> 
          option in the <TT><B>output format</B></TT> list. In order to see
          this output format option, you must have a genePred table 
          selected. 
          If you limit your search to a certain position range within the
          genome (rather than searching the entire genome), the tool
          will return FASTA alignments for all genes that overlap
          the position for which you are searching. 
          The Table Browser will present you with a configuration page.
          On this page, you can select options for your ouput.
          </P>
          <P>
          First, select your MAF table.  This is the table from which 
          the multiple alignments will be extracted for the CDS regions
          of your gene track. If you do not know the name of the MAF table
          that corresponds to the Conservation track, you can find it in the
          Genome Browser by following these 
          <A HREF="../../FAQ/FAQtracks.html#tracks21">instructions</A>. 
          </P>
	  <P>
          Then select any of the following choices:
	    <UL>
	    <LI><B>Separate into exons</B> -
	    The default behavior is for the coding exons of each gene to be
            concatenated into
	    one sequence in the output FASTA multiple alignment. In this
	    case each output row header has the format listed
	    below under &quot;Whole gene format&quot;.
	    If the separate into exons option is chosen then each exon will be
	    listed with a separate header in the format
	    listed below under &quot;Exon format&quot;.<br>
            <LI><B>Show nucleotides</B> -
	    The default behavior is for the nucleotides in the alignment
            to be translated
	    into amino acids according to the strand and exon frames
	    defined in the selected genePred table.
            If this option is chosen, then the nucleotides
	    in the alignment will not be translated into amino
	    acids.        
            <LI><B>Output lines with just dashes</B> - 
	    The default behavior is for the alignment rows that contain
            only dashes to not be printed.  If this option is chosen, then
	    these dashes-only rows are printed.
            <LI><B>Format output as table</B> - 
            If this option is chosen, the header and sequence for each organism
            will appear on the same line.
              <UL>
              <LI><B>Truncate headers as __ characters (enter zero for
              no headers)</B> -
              This option works in conjunction with the &quot;Format output
              as table&quot; option. 
              If you want to see only a portion of the headers, choose this
              option, and enter the number of characters at which you would 
              like the headers truncated.
              </UL>
            </UL>
         Finally, from the list of species, select those that you would
         like included in the FASTA multiple alignment output.  Press
         the &quot;get output&quot; button to view the output.

              acids in the peptide.
	      <LI><B>location</B>- this is the chromosome position within the 
	      assembly that is aligned in the multiple alignment.  The format
	      of this string is chrom:start-end followed by the strand
	      where the alignment occurs.  If more than one region is
	      aligned then all the regions are listed with a semi-colon (;)
	      between each position.  This address is in genome browser
	      coordinates (i.e. the start address is 
              <A HREF="../../FAQ/FAQtracks.html#tracks1">one-based</A>).
	      <LI><B>exonNum</B>- the ordinal of the exon.  Exons are

	      and progress along the strand of transcription.
	      <LI><B>totalExons</B>- the number of coding exons in the gene.

	      the number of amino acids in 
	      the exon (with amino acids translated from split codons 
	      placed in the exon where two of the three nucleotides lie).
	      <LI><B>inFrame</B>- the frame number of the first nucleotide

         As noted above, the CDS FASTA output files can be in either DNA-space 
         or protein-space.
         </P>
         <P>
         In some instances, there is a dash (&quot;&ndash;&quot;) in the 
         sequence portion of the CDS FASTA file. Dashes are used in several 
         circumstances.  They indicate missing sequence for the aligning 
         genome, as well as deletions in the aligning genome or insertions
         in the base genome.
         </P>
         <P>
         Because the CDS FASTA alignments are based on one reference
         genome, any amino acids or nucleotides that are not
         in the reference genome are not displayed.  Consequently the peptides
         shown for aligning genomes are not necessarily the peptide that
         the other organisms' gene would generate.  Any sequence inserted
         in an aligning genome or deleted in the base genome will not be 
         present in the alignment.  We represent this condition
         with an orange bar in the Genome Browser display, but
         the CDS FASTA alignments silently ignore this issue. 
         </P>
         <P>
         &mdash; Nucleotide CDS FASTA sequence:<BR>
         Consider the example below that shows the FASTA sequence for four
         species aligned with the first exon of the human gene
         PLEKHO1 (UCSC Gene: uc001ett.1). Note that the rat (rn4) row 
         is missing 
         the first three nucleotides.  This could be due to a 
         lineage-specific insertion between the rat and  
         human genomes, or a lineage-specific deletion between the
         human and rat genomes. Note also that the Zebrafish 
         (danRer4) row contains only dashes.  This could be due to 
         excessive evolutionary distance between the zebrafish and human, 
         missing data in the zebrafish, or independent indels in the region in
         both species. Sometimes it is helpful to view the  
         Conservation track in the Genome Browser in this area to
         clarify the exact meaning of the dashes.
