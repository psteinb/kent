<P>
As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research re-focuses on 
their analysis, the issue of effective sequence display becomes critical: it is not 
helpful to have 3 billion letters of genomic DNA shown as plain text! As an 
alternative, the UCSC Genome Browser provides a rapid and reliable display of any 
requested portion of genomes at any scale, together with dozens of 
aligned annotation tracks (known genes, predicted genes, ESTs, mRNAs, CpG islands, 
assembly gaps and coverage, chromosomal bands, mouse homologies, and more). Half of 
the annotation tracks are computed at UCSC from publicly available
sequence data. The remaining tracks are provided by collaborators worldwide. Users can 
also add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research
purposes.
<P>
The Genome Browser stacks annotation tracks beneath genome 
coordinate positions, allowing rapid visual correlation of different types of 
information. The user can look at a whole chromosome to get a feel for gene 
density, open a specific cytogenetic band to see a positionally mapped disease gene 
candidate, or zoom in to a particular gene to view its spliced ESTs and possible 
alternative splicing. The Genome Browser itself does not draw conclusions; rather, it 
collates all relevant information in one location, leaving the exploration and 
interpretation to the user.
<P>
The Genome Browser supports text and sequence based searches that provide quick, precise 
access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual
entries within annotation tracks lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site 
databases.  To control information overload, tracks need not be displayed in full. Tracks
can be hidden, collapsed into a condensed or single-line display, or filtered according 
to the user's criteria.  Zooming and scrolling controls help to narrow or broaden the 
displayed chromosomal range to focus on the exact region of interest. 
Clicking on an individual item within a track opens a details page containing a 
summary of properties and links to off-site repositories such as 
PubMed, GenBank, Entrez, and OMIM. The page provides item-specific information on 
position, cytoband, strand, data source, and encoded protein, mRNA, genomic sequence 
and alignment, as appropriate to the nature of the track.
<P>
A blue navigation bar at the top of the browser provides links to several other tools 
and data sources. For instance, under the &quot;View&quot; menu, the &quot;DNA&quot; link
enables the user to view the raw genomic DNA sequence for the coordinate range 
displayed in the browser window. This DNA can encode track features via elaborate 
text formatting options. Other links tie the Genome Browser to the BLAT 
alignment tool, provide access to the underlying relational database via the
Table Browser, convert coordinates across different assembly dates, and open the 
window at the complementary <A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/" TARGET=_blank>Ensembl</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/" TARGET=_blank>NCBI Map 
Viewer</A> annotation.
<P>
The browser data represents an immense 
<A HREF="../credits.html">collaborative effort</A> 
involving thousands of people from the international biomedical research community. 
The UCSC Bioinformatics Group itself does no sequencing. Although it creates 
the majority of the annotation tracks in-house, the annotations are based on
publicly available data contributed by many labs and research groups throughout
the world. Several of the Genome Browser annotations are generated in 
collaboration with outside individuals or are contributed wholly by external
research groups. UCSC's
other major roles include building genome assemblies, creating the Genome Browser work 
environment, and serving it online. The majority of the sequence data, annotation tracks, and even 
software are in the public domain and are available for anyone
to <A HREF="#Download">download</A>. 
<P>
In addition to the Genome Browser, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group provides 
several other tools for viewing and interpreting genome data:

<P>
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics <A HREF="../../index.html" 
TARGET=_blank>home page</A>
provides access to Genome Browsers on several different genome assemblies. 
To get started, click the Browser link on the blue sidebar. This will take 
you to a Gateway page where you can select which genome to display.
Note that there is also an official
<a href="genomeEuro.html">European mirror site</a> for users who are geographically
closer to central Europe than to the western United States.
<P>
<B>Opening the Genome Browser at a specific position</B><BR> 
To get oriented in using the Genome Browser, try viewing a gene or region of 
the genome with which you are already familiar, or use the default position. 
To open the Genome Browser window:
<TABLE>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top"><B>1.</B></TD><TD>
	Select the clade, genome and assembly that you wish to display from 
	the corresponding pull-down menus. Assemblies are typically named by the first
        three characters of an organism's genus and species names. For older assemblies
	that are no longer available from the menu,
        the data may still be available on our <A HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html"
	TARGET=_blank>Downloads</A> page.
</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top"><B>2.</B></TD><TD>
	Specify the genome location you'd like the Genome Browser to open to.
	To select a location, enter a valid position query in the 
	<I>search term</I> text box at the top of the Gateway 
	page or accept the default position already 
	displayed. The search supports several different types of 
	<A HREF="query.html">queries</A>: gene 
	symbols, mRNA or EST accession numbers, chromosome 
	bands, descriptive terms likely to occur in GenBank text, or specific chromosomal 
	ranges. 
	</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top"><B>3.</B></TD><TD>
	Click the <I>submit</I> button to open up the Genome Browser window to the
	requested location. In cases where a specific term (accession, gene name,
	etc.) was queried, the item will be highlighted in the display.
	</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Occasionally the Gateway page returns a list of several matches in response 
to a search, rather than immediately displaying the Genome Browser 
window. When this occurs, click on the item in which you're interested and 
the Genome Browser will open to that location.
<P>
The search mechanism is not a site-wide search engine. Instead, it 
primarily searches GenBank mRNA records whose text annotations can include 
gene names, gene symbols, journal title words, author names, and RefSeq 
mRNAs. Searches on other selected identifiers, such as NP and NM accession 
numbers, OMIM identifiers, and Entrez Gene IDs are supported.  However, some 
types of queries will return an error, e.g. post-assembly GenBank 
entries, withdrawn gene names, and abandoned synonyms. If your initial
query is unsuccessful, try entering a different related term that
may produce the same location. For example, if a query on a gene symbol
produces no results, try entering an mRNA accession, gene ID number, or
descriptive words associated with the gene.
<P>
<B>Finding a genome location using BLAT</B><BR>
If you have genomic, mRNA, or protein sequence, but don't know the name or
the location to which it maps in the genome, the <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgBlat">
BLAT</A> tool will rapidly locate the position by homology alignment, provided that the 
region has been sequenced. This search will find close members of the gene
family, as well as assembly duplication artifacts. An entire set of query sequences can 
be looked up simultaneously when provided in fasta format. 
<P>
A successful BLAT search 
returns a list of one or more genome locations that match the input sequence. To
view one of the alignments in the Genome Browser, click the <I>browser</I> link for the 
match. The <I>details</I> link can be used to preview the alignment to determine if
it is of sufficient match quality to merit viewing in the Genome Browser. If too many BLAT hits 
occur, try narrowing the search by filtering the sequence in slow mode with
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A>, then rerunning the BLAT search. 
<P>
For more information
on conducting and fine-tuning BLAT searches, refer to the <A HREF="#BLATAlign">
BLAT section</A> of this document.
<P>
<B>Opening the Genome Browser with a custom annotation track</B><BR>
You can open the Genome Browser window with a custom annotation track displayed
by using the Add Custom Tracks feature available from the gateway and annotation
tracks pages.
For more information on creating and using custom annotation tracks, refer to 
the <A HREF="#CustomTracks">Creating custom annotation tracks</A> section.
<P>
Annotation track data can be entered in one of three ways:
<TABLE>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD>
	Enter the file name for an annotation track source file in the
	Annotation File text box.
	</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD>
	Type or paste the annotation track data into the large text box.
	</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD>
	If the annotation data are accessible through a URL, enter the URL name in the 
	large text box.
	</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Once you've entered the annotation information, click the <I>submit</I> button at the top of 
the Gateway page to open up the Genome Browser with the annotation track
displayed.
<P>
The Genome Browser also provides a <A HREF="../customTracks/custTracks.html"
TARGET=_blank>collection of custom annotation tracks</A> contributed by the UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics group and the research community. 

<P><B>NOTE:</B> If an annotation track does not display correctly when
you attempt to upload it, you may need to reset the Genome Browser to 
its default settings, then reload the track. For information on
troubleshooting display problems with custom annotation tracks, refer to the
troubleshooting section in the <A HREF="#CustomTracks">Creating custom
annotation tracks</A> section.
<P>
<B>Viewing genome data as text</B><BR> 
The 
<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgTables" TARGET=_blank>Table Browser</A>,
a portal to the underlying open source <A
HREF="http://www.MySQL.com" TARGET=_blank>MySQL</A> relational database driving the Genome
Browser, displays genomic data as columns of text rather than as
graphical tracks. For more information on using the Table Browser, see the
section <A HREF="#TableBrowser"> Getting Started: on the Table Browser</A>.
<P>
<B>Opening the Genome Browser from external gateways</B><BR> 
Several external gateways provide direct links into the Genome Browser. Examples
include: <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/" TARGET=_blank>Entrez Gene</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/index.html"
TARGET=_blank>AceView</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/" TARGET=_blank>Ensembl</A>, <A
HREF="http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/" TARGET=_blank>SuperFamily</A>, 
and <A
HREF="http://www.genecards.org/" TARGET=_blank>GeneCards</A>. Journal
articles can also link to the browser and provide custom tracks. Be sure to use
the assembly date appropriate to the provided coordinates when using data from
a journal source.
<P>
<B>Tips for Use</B><BR>
To facilitate your return to regions of interest within the Genome
Browser, save the coordinate range or bookmark the page of displays that you plan to 
revisit or wish to share with others. 
<P>
It is usually best to work with the most recent assembly even though a full 
set of tracks might not yet be ready. Be aware that the coordinates of a given feature 
on an unfinished chromosome may change from one assembly to the next as
gaps are filled, artifactual duplications are reduced, and strand orientations
are corrected.  The Genome Browser offers multiple tools that can correctly 
convert coordinates between different assembly releases. For more information
on conversion tools,
see the section <A HREF="#Convert">Converting data between assemblies</A>.
<P>
To ensure uninterrupted browser services for your research during UCSC server 
maintenance and power outages, bookmark a
<A HREF="../../mirror.html" TARGET=_blank>mirror</A> site that 
replicates the UCSC genome browser. 
<P>
Bear in mind that the Genome Browser cannot outperform the underlying quality of 
the draft genome. Assembly errors and sequence gaps may still occur well into
the sequencing process due to regions that are intrinsically difficult to sequence. 
Artifactual duplications arise as unavoidable compromises during a build, causing 
misleading matches in genome coordinates found by alignment.

The Genome Browser annotation tracks page displays a genome location 
specified through a Gateway search, a BLAT search, or an uploaded 
custom annotation track. There are five main features on this page: a set of 
<A HREF="#NAV">navigation controls</A>, a 
chromosome ideogram, the annotations tracks image, 
<A HREF=#TRACK_CONFIG>display configuration buttons</A>, and a set of track 
<A HREF="#TRACK_CONT">display controls</A>.
<P>
The first time you open the
Genome Browser, it will use the application default values to configure the
annotation tracks display. By manipulating the navigation, configuration 
and display controls, you can customize the annotation tracks display to 
suit your needs. 
For a complete description of the annotation tracks available in all assembly
versions supported by the Genome Browser, see the <A HREF="#IndivTracks">
Annotation Track Descriptions</A> section.
<P>
The Genome Browser retains user preferences from session to session within the
same web browser, although it never monitors or records user activities or 
submitted data. 
To restore the default settings, click the &quot;Click here to reset&quot; 
link on the Genome Browser Gateway page. To return the display to the default 
set of tracks (but retain custom tracks and other configured Genome Browser 
settings), click the <I>default tracks</I> button on the Genome Browser page.
<P>
<B>Display conventions</B><BR>
The annotation tracks displayed in the Genome Browser use a common set of
display conventions:<BR>
<TABLE>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Annotation track
	descriptions:</B> 
	Each annotation track has an associated description page that contains a
	discussion of the track, the methods used to create the annotation, the 
        data 
	sources and credits for the track, and (in some cases) filter and
	configuration options to
	fine-tune the information displayed in the track. To view the
	description page, click on the mini-button to the left of a displayed
	track or on the label for the track in the Track Controls section.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Annotation track
	details pages:</B> 
	When an annotation track is displayed in full, pack, or squish mode, 
	each line item
	within the track has an associated details page that can be displayed by 
	clicking on the item or its label. The
	information contained in the details page varies by annotation track, but
	may include basic position information about the item, related links 
	to outside sites 
	and databases, links to genomic alignments, or links to corresponding
	mRNA, genomic, and protein sequences.
	</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><A NAME="GeneDisplay"></A><B>Gene prediction tracks:</B> 
	Coding exons are represented by blocks connected by horizontal lines
	representing introns. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are displayed 
	as thinner blocks on the leading and trailing ends of the aligning
	regions. In full display mode, arrowheads on
	the connecting intron lines indicate the direction of transcription.
	In situations where no intron is visible (e.g. single-exon genes,
	extremely zoomed-in displays), the arrowheads are displayed on the exon 
	block itself.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><A NAME="PSLDisplay"></A><B>Pattern Space Layout (PSL) alignment 
	tracks:</B> 
	Aligning regions (usually exons when the query is cDNA) are shown as black blocks. In dense display 
	mode, the degree of darkness corresponds to the number of features aligning to 
	the region or the degree of quality of the match. In pack or full display mode, 
	the aligning regions are connected by lines 
	representing gaps in the alignment (typically spliced-out introns), with arrowheads indicating 
	the orientation of the alignment, pointing right if the query sequence was aligned
	to the forward strand of the genome and left if aligned to the reverse strand.  
	Two parallel lines are drawn over double-sided alignment gaps, which skip over
        unalignable sequence in both target and query.  
	For alignments of ESTs, the arrows may be reversed to show the apparent 
	direction of transcription deduced from splice junction sequences.
	In situations where no gap lines are 
	visible, the arrowheads are displayed on the block itself. 
	To prevent display problems, the Genome Browser imposes an upper 
	limit on the number of alignments that can be viewed simultaneously 
	within the tracks image. When this limit is exceeded, the Browser 
	displays the best several hundred alignments in a condensed display
	mode, then lists the number of undisplayed alignments in the last 
	row of the track. In this situation, try zooming in to display 
	more entries or to return the track to full display mode. 
	For some PSL tracks, <A HREF="hgCodonColoringMrna.html">extra coloring</A> 
	to indicate mismatching bases and query-only gaps may be available.</TD></TR>

<A NAME="ChainDisplay"></A>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>&quot;Chain&quot; tracks 
	(2-species alignment):</B> 
	Chain tracks display boxes joined together by either single or double 
	lines. The boxes represent aligning regions. Single lines indicate gaps 
	that are largely due to a deletion in the genome of the first species or 
	an insertion in the genome of the second species. Double lines represent 
	more complex gaps that involve substantial sequence in both species. 
	This may result from inversions, overlapping deletions, an abundance of 
	local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one species. In cases where 
	there are multiple chains over a particular portion of the genome, 
	chains with single-lined gaps are often due to processed pseudogenes, 
	while chains with double-lined gaps are more often due to paralogs and 
	unprocessed pseudogenes. In the fuller display modes, the individual 
	feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and location 
	(in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment. </TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><A NAME="NetDisplay"></A><B>&quot;Net&quot; tracks 
	(2-species alignment):</B> 
	Boxes represent ungapped alignments, while lines represent gaps. Clicking

        <TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Snake tracks 
        (alignment tracks):</B>
	The snake alignment track (or snake track) shows the relationship between 
	the chosen Browser genome (reference genome) and another genome (query genome). 
	A snake is a way of viewing a set of pairwise gapless alignments 
	that may overlap on both the reference and query genomes. 
	Alignments are always represented as being on the positive strand 
	of the reference species, but can be on either strand on the query 
	sequence.
	<p>
	In full display mode, a snake track can be decomposed into two drawing 
	elements: segments (colored rectangles) and adjacencies 
	(lines connecting the segments). Segments represent subsequences 
	of the target genome aligned to the given portion of the reference 
	genome. Adjacencies represent the covalent bonds between the aligned 
	subsequences of the target genome.
	</p>
	<p>
	Red tick-marks within segments represent substitutions with respect to the reference, 
	shown in windows of the reference of (by default) up to 50 Kb.
	Zoomed in to the base level, these substitutions are labeled with the non-reference base.
	</p>
	<p>
	An insertion in the reference relative to the query creates a gap between 
	abutting segment sides that is connected by an adjacency. An insertion 
	in the query relative to the reference is represented by an orange 
	tick-mark that splits a segment at the location the extra bases 
	would be inserted. Simultaneous independent insertions in both 
	query and reference look like an insertion in the reference 
	relative to the target, except that the corresponding adjacency 
	connecting the two segments is colored orange. More complex 
	structural rearrangements create adjacencies that connect the 
	sides of non-abutting segments in a natural fashion. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Pack mode can be used to display a larger number of snake tracks 
	in the limited vertical browser. This mode eliminates the adjacencies from the display 
	and forces the segments onto as few rows as possible, given the constraint of still showing 
	duplications in the query sequence.
	</p>
	<p>
	Dense mode further eliminates these duplications so that each snake track is compactly 
	represented along just one row. 
	</p>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>&quot;Wiggle&quot; 
	tracks:</B> 
	These tracks plot a continuous function along a chromosome. Data is 
	displayed in windows of a set number of base pairs in width. 
	The score for each window 
	displays as "mountain ranges". The display characteristics vary among
	the tracks in this group. See the individual track descriptions for more
	information on interpreting the display. If the "mountain peak" is
	taller or shorter than what can be shown in the display, it is 
	clipped and colored magenta.</TD></TR>
</TABLE> 
<P>
<A NAME="TRACK_CONT"></A>
<B>Changing the display mode of an individual annotation track</B><BR>
Each annotation track within the window may have up to five display modes: 
<P>
<TABLE>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Hide:</B> the
	track is not displayed at all. To hide all the annotation tracks,
	click the <I>hide all</I> button. This mode is useful for restricting
	the display to only those tracks in which you are interested. For
	example, someone who is not interested in SNPs or mouse synteny may want 
	to hide these tracks to reduce track clutter and improve speed. There
	are a few annotation tracks that pertain only to one specific
	chromosome, e.g. Sanger22, Rosetta. In these cases, the track and its 
	associated controller will be hidden automatically when the track window is 
	not open to the relevant chromosome.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Dense:</B> the 
	track is displayed with all features collapsed into a single 
	line. This mode is useful for reducing the amount of space used by a
	track when you don't need individual line item details or when you just
	want to get an overall view of an annotation. For example, by opening an
	entire chromosome and setting the RefSeq Genes track to dense, you can get 
	a feel for the known gene density of the chromosome without displaying
	excessive detail. </TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Full:</B> the
	track is displayed with each annotation feature on a separate line. It is
	recommended that you use this option sparingly, due to the large number
	of individual track items that may potentially align at the selected position. For
	example, hundreds of ESTs might align with a specified gene. When
	the number of lines within a requested track location exceeds 250, the
	track automatically defaults to a more tightly-packed display mode. In 
	this situation,
	you can restore the track display to full mode by narrowing the chromosomal 
	range displayed or by using a track filter to reduce the number of items 
	displayed. On tracks that contain only hide, dense, and full modes, you 
	can toggle between full and dense display modes by clicking on the
	track's center label.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Squish:</B> the 
	track is displayed with each annotation feature shown separately, but
	at 50% the height of full mode. Features are unlabeled, and more than one
	may be drawn on the same line. This mode is useful for reducing the 
	amount of space used by a track when you want to view a large number of
	individual features and get an overall view of an annotation. It is
	particularly good for displaying tracks in which a large number of 
	features align to a particular section of a chromosome, e.g. EST tracks. 
	</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>Pack:</B> the 
	track is displayed with each annotation feature shown separately and
	labeled, but not necessarily displayed on a separate line. 
	This mode is useful for reducing the 
	amount of space used by a track when you want to view the large number of
	individual features allowed by squish mode, but need the labeling and
	display size provided by full mode. When the number of lines within the
	requested track location exceeds 250, the track automatically defaults
	to squish display mode. In this situation, you can restore the track 
	display to pack mode by narrowing the chromosomal range displayed or by 
	using a track filter to reduce the number of items 
	displayed.  To toggle between pack and full display modes, click on 
	the track's center label.
	</TD></TR>
</TABLE> 
<P>
The track display controls are grouped into categories that reflect the type 
of data in the track, e.g. Gene Prediction Tracks, mRNA and EST tracks, etc. 
To change the display mode for a track, find the track's controller in the
Track Controls section at the bottom of the Genome Browser page, select the desired
mode from the control's display menu, and then click the <I>refresh</I> button. 
Alternatively, you can change the display mode by using the Genome
Browser's <A HREF="#RIGHT_CLICK_NAV">right-click navigation</A> feature,
or can toggle between dense and full modes 
for a displayed track (or pack mode when available) by clicking on the optional 
center label for the track. 
<P>
<B>Changing the display mode for a group of tracks</B><BR>
Track display modes may be set individually or as a group on the Genome
Browser Track Configuration page. To access the configuration page, click the
<em>configure</em> button on the annotation tracks page or the 
<em>configure tracks and display</em> button on the Gateway page. Exercise
caution when using the <em>show all</em> buttons on track groups or 
assemblies that contain a large number tracks; this may seriously impact the
display performance of the Genome Browser or cause your Internet browser to
time out.
<P>
<B>Hiding the track display controls</B><BR>
The entire set of track display controls at the bottom of the annotation 
tracks page may be hidden from view by checking the <em>Show track controls 
under main graphic</em> option in the Configure Image section of the Track 
Configuration page.
<P>
<B>Changing the display of a track by using filters and configuration options</B><BR>
Some tracks have additional filter and configuration capabilities, 
e.g. EST tracks, mRNA tracks, NC160, etc. These options
let the user modify the color or restrict the data displayed within an annotation track.
Filters are useful for focusing attention on items relevant to the current task
in tracks that contain large amounts of data. For example, to highlight ESTs
expressed in the liver, set the EST track filter to display items in a
different color when the associated tissue keyword is "liver". Configuration
options let the user adjust the display to best show the data of interest.
For example, the min vertical viewing range value on wiggle tracks
can be used to establish a data threshold. By setting the min value to &quot;50&quot;, only data values greater than 50 percent will display.
<P>
To access filter and configuration options for a specific annotation track, open
the tracks' description page by clicking the label for the track's control menu 
under the Track Controls section, the mini-button to the left of the displayed 
track, or the &quot;Configure...&quot; option from the Genome Browser's 
<A HREF="#RIGHT_CLICK_NAV">right-click</A> popup menu.
The filter and configration section is located at the top of the 
description page. In most instances, more information about the configuration 
options is available within the description text or through a special help link 
located in the configuration section. 
<P>
Filter and configuration settings are persistent from session to session on the 
same web browser. To return the Genome Browser display to the default set of 
tracks (but retain custom tracks and other configured Genome Browser settings),
click the 
<I>default tracks</I> button on the Genome Browser tracks page.
To remove all user configuration settings and custom tracks, and completely 
restore the defaults, click the &quot;Click here to reset&quot; link on the 
Genome Browser Gateway page. 
<P>
<A NAME="NAV"></A>
<B>Zooming and scrolling the tracks display</B><BR>
At times you may want to adjust the amount of flanking region displayed in the
annotation tracks window or adjust the scale of the display. At a scale of 1 pixel per 
base pair, the window accurately displays the width of exons and introns, and 
indicates the direction of transcription (using arrowheads) for multi-exon features. At a 
grosser scale, certain features - such as thin exons - may disappear. Also, some
exons may falsely appear to fall within RepeatMasker features at some scales. 
<P>
Click the <I>zoom in</I> and <I>zoom out</I> buttons at the top of the 
Genome Browser page to zoom in or out on the center of the annotation tracks window by 1.5, 3 or
10-fold. Alternatively, you can zoom in 3-fold on the display by clicking
anywhere on the
Base Position track. In this case, the zoom is centered on the coordinate of the
mouse click.  To view the base composition of the sequence underlying the
current annotation track display, click the <em>base</em> button. 
<P>
Quickly zoom to a specific region of interest by using the browser's 
"drag-and-select" feature. To define the region you wish to zoom to, 
click and hold the mouse button on one edge of the desired 
zoom area in the Base Position track, drag the mouse right or left to highlight 
the selection area, then release the mouse button. A "drag-and-select" popup will appear. 
Click on the "Zoom In" button to zoom in on the selected region. 
To disable the drag-and-select popup, check the "Don't show this dialog again and always zoom" checkbox.
To drag-and-select (zoom) on a part of the image other than the Base Position track, 
depress the shift key before clicking and dragging the mouse. 
Note that the <em>Enable advanced javascript 
features</em> option on the Track Configuration page must be toggled on to use 
this feature. 
<P>
To scroll (pan) the view of the entire tracks image horizontally, click on the 
image and drag the cursor to the left or right, then release the mouse button, 
to shift the displayed region in the corresponding direction. The view may be 
scrolled by up to one image width.
To scroll the annotation tracks horizontally by set increments of 10%, 50%, or 
95% of the displayed
size (as given in base pairs), click the corresponding <I>move</I> arrow. It is also 
possible to scroll the left or right side of the tracks by a specified number
of vertical gridlines while keeping the
position of the opposite side fixed. To do this, click the appropriate <I>move 
start</I> or <I>move end</I> arrow, located under the annotation tracks window.
For example, to keep the left-hand display coordinate fixed but increase the
right-hand coordinate, you would click the right-hand <I>move end</I> arrow. To increase
or decrease the gridline scroll interval, edit the value in the <I>move start</I> or
<I>move end</I> text box. 
<P>
<A NAME="Highlight"></A>
<B>Highlighting a region</B><BR>
The browser's "drag-and-select" feature also allows you to highlight a 
region or gene of interest. To highlight a region, click and hold the 
mouse button on one edge of the desired area to be highlighted in the Base Position track, 
drag the mouse right or left to highlight the selection area, 
then release the mouse button. Click the "Highlight" button on the 
"drag-and-select" popup. Note, if the "drag-and-select" popup has been disabled, 
you may re-enable it on the browser image 'configure' page by selecting
"Enable highlight with drag-and-select (if unchecked, drag-and-select always zooms to selection)".
<P>
Options to remove highlighting, zoom in to a highlighted region, 
or jump to a highlighted region, can be found on the browser's right-click menu. 
<P>
To highlight a gene of interest, right-click on the gene 
(e.g., SOD1) and select "Highlight SOD1".
<P>
<B>Changing the displayed track position</B><BR>
To display a completely different position in the genome, enter the new query in
the <I>position/search</I> text box, then click the <I>jump</I> button. For more information on
valid entries for this text box, refer to the <A HREF="#GetStarted">Getting

<P>
If a chromosome image (ideogram) is available above the track display, click anywhere
on the chromosome to  move to that position (the current window size will be
maintained). Select a region of any size by clicking and dragging in the image.
Finally, hold the &quot;control&quot; key while clicking on a chromosome band
to select the entire band.
<P>
<B>Changing the order of the displayed tracks</B><BR>
To vertically reposition a track in the annotation track window, click-and-hold 
the mouse button on the side label, then drag the highlighted track up or down 
within the image. Release the mouse button when the track is in the desired 
position. To move an entire group of associated tracks (such as all the
displayed subtracks in a composite track), click-and-hold the gray mini-button 
to the left of the tracks, then drag.
<P>
<A NAME="TRACK_CONFIG"></A>
<B>Changing the width of the annotation track window</B><BR>
The first time the annotation track window is displayed, or after the
Genome Browser has been reset, the size of the track window is 
set by default to the width that best fits your Internet browser window. If you
horizontally resize the browser window, you can automatically adjust the 
annotation track image size to the new width by clicking the <em>resize</em> 
button under the track image. To manually override the default width, enter a 
new value in the <em>image width</em> text box on the Track Configuration page, 
then click the <em>submit</em> button. The maximum supported width is 5000 pixels.
<P>
<B>Changing the width of the label area to the left of the image</B><BR>
The item labels (or track label, when viewed in dense mode) are displayed to
the left of the annotation image. The width of this area is set to 17 
characters by default. To change the width, edit the value in the <em>label
area width</em> text box on the Track Configuration page, then click 
<em>Submit</em>.
<P>
<B>Changing the text size in the annotation track image</B><BR>
The annotation track image may be adjusted to display text in a range of
fonts from &quot;tiny&quot; to &quot;huge&quot;. To change the size of the
text, select an option from the <em>text size</em> pull-down menu on the 
Track Configuration page, then click <em>Submit</em>. The text size is set to
&quot;small&quot; by default.
<P>
<B>Hiding the annotation track labels</B><BR>
The track and element labels displayed above and to the left of the tracks
in the annotation tracks image may be hidden from view by unchecking the
<em>Display track descriptions above each track</em> and <em>Display labels 
to the left of items in tracks</em> boxes, respectively, on the Track 
Configuration page.
<P>
<B>Hiding the display grid on the annotation tracks image</B><BR>
The light blue vertical guidelines on the annotation tracks image may be
removed by unchecking the <em>Show light blue vertical guidelines</em> box
on the Track Configuration page.
<P>
<B>Hiding the chromosome ideogram</B><BR>
The chromosome ideogram, located just above the annotation tracks image,
provides a graphical overview of the features on the selected chromosome, 
including its bands, the position of the centromere, and an indication of
the region currently displayed in the annotation tracks image. 
To hide the ideogram, uncheck the <em>Display chromosome ideogram above 
main graphic</em> box on the Tracks Configuration page.
<P>
<B>Enabling item and exon navigation</B><BR>
When the <em>Next/previous item navigation</em> configuration option is 
toggled on, on the Track Configuration page,  
gray double-headed arrows display in the Genome Browser tracks image on both 
sides of the track labels of gene, mRNA and EST tracks (or any standard tracks 
based on BED, PSL or genePred format). Clicking on the gray arrows shifts the
image window toward that end of the chromosome so that the next item in the
track is displayed. Similarly, the
<em>Next/previous exon navigation</em> configuration option displays white 
double-headed arrows on 
both the 5' and 3' end of each track item that has exons positioned beyond the 
edges of the current image. Clicking on one of the white arrows shifts the image
window to the next exon located towards that end of the feature.
<P>
<A NAME="RIGHT_CLICK_NAV"></A>
<B>Enabling the right-click navigation feature</B><BR>
Several of the common display and navigation operations offered on the
Genome Browser tracks page may be quickly accessed by right-clicking on
a feature on the tracks image and selecting an option from the displayed
popup menu. Depending on context, the right-click feature allows the
user to:
<UL>
<LI>change the track display mode
<LI>zoom in or out to the exact position coordinates of the feature
<LI>open the &quot;Get DNA&quot; window at the feature's coordinates
<LI>display details about the feature 
<LI>open a popup window to configure the track's display
<LI>display the entire tracks image in a
separate window for inclusion in spreadsheets or other documents. (Note
that the Genome Browser &quot;PDF/PS&quot; described below can also be
used to generate a high-quality annotation tracks image suitable for
printing.)
</UL>
<P>
To use the right-click feature, make sure the <em>Enable advanced
javascript features</em> option on the Track Configuration page is checked,
and configure your internet browser to allow the display of popup
windows from genome.ucsc.edu. When enabled, the right-click navigation
feature replaces the default contextual popup menu typically displayed by the
internet browser when a user right-clicks on the tracks image. A few
combinations of the Mozilla Firefox browser on Mac OS do not support the
right-click menu functionality using secondary click; in these
instances, ctrl+left-click must be used to display the menu. 
<P>
<B>Printing a copy of the annotation track window</B><BR>
The Genome Browser provides a mechanism for saving a copy of 
the currently displayed annotation tracks image to a file that can be printed 
or edited. Images saved in PostScript format can be printed at high resolution
and edited by drawing programs such as Adobe Illustrator. This is useful for
generating figures intended for publication. Images can also be saved in PDF
format for viewing by Adobe Acrobat Reader.
<P>
To print or save the image to a file:

BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) is a very fast sequence alignment tool similar to 
BLAST. 
For more information on BLAT's internal scoring schemes and its overall n-mer 
alignment seed strategy, refer to W. James Kent (2002) <A
HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>BLAT -
The BLAST-Like Alignment Tool</A>, <em>Genome Res</em> 12:4 656-664. 
<P>
On DNA queries, BLAT is designed to quickly find sequences with 95% or greater 
similarity of length 25 bases or more. It may miss genomic alignments that
are more divergent or shorter than these minimums, although it will find perfect 
sequence matches of 32 bases and sometimes as few as 22 bases. The tool is
capable of aligning sequences that contain large introns. 
On protein queries, BLAT rapidly locates genomic sequences with 80% or greater 
similarity of length 20 amino acids or more. In general, gene family members that 
arose within the last 350 million years can generally be detected. More
divergent sequences can be aligned to the human genome by using NCBI's BLAST and
psi-BLAST, then using BLAT to align the resulting match onto the UCSC genome 
assembly. In practice DNA BLAT works well on primates, and protein BLAT works
well on land vertebrates.

<P><B>BLAT limitations</B><BR>
DNA input sequences are limited to a maximum length of 25,000 bases. Protein or
translated input sequences must not exceed 10,000 letters. As many as 25 multiple 
sequences may be submitted at the same time. The maximum combined length of DNA 
input for multiple sequence submissions is 50,000 bases (with a 25,000 base 
limit per individual sequence). For 
protein or translated input, the maximum combined input length is 25,000 letters 
(with a 5000 letter limit per individual sequence). 
<P>
NOTE: Program-driven BLAT use is
limited to a maximum of one hit every 15 seconds and no more than 5000 hits per
day.
<P><B>BLAT query search results</B><BR>
If a query returns successfully, BLAT will display a flat database file that 
summarizes the alignments found. A BLAT query often generates multiple 
hits. This can happen when the genome contains 
multiple copies of a sequence, paralogs, pseudogenes, statistical coincidences, 
artifactual assembly duplications, or when the query itself contains repeats or common 
retrotransposons. When too many hits occur, try resubmitting the query sequence
after filtering in slow mode with RepeatMasker. 
<P>
Items in the search results list are ordered by the criteria specified in the 
<I>Sort output</I> menu. Each line item provides links to view the details of the sequence 
alignment or to open the corresponding view in the Genome Browser. The
<I>details</I> link gives the letter-by-letter alignment of the sequence to the 
genome. It is recommended 
that you first examine the details of the alignment for match quality before viewing
the sequence in the Genome Browser. 
<P>
When several nearby BLAT matches occur on a single chromosome, a 
simple trick can be used to quickly adjust the Genome Browser track window to display 
all of them: open the Genome Browser with the match that has the lowest chromosome 
start coordinate, paste in the highest chromosome end coordinate from the list of 
matches, then click the <I>jump</I> button. 
<P><B>Creating a custom annotation track from BLAT output</B><BR>
To make a custom track directly from BLAT, select the 
<A HREF="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2">PSL format</A>

<P>
The Genome Browser provides a feature to configure the retrieval, formatting,
and coloring of the text used to depict the DNA sequence underlying the features in the displayed 
annotation tracks window. Retrieval options allow the user to add a padding of 
extra bases to the upstream or downstream end of the sequence. Formatting options range from simply displaying exons in upper case to 
elaborately marking up a sequence according to multiple track data. The DNA sequence covered by 
various tracks can be highlighted by case, underlining, bold or italic fonts, and color.
<P>
The DNA display configuration feature can be useful to highlight features within a
genomic sequence, point out overlaps between two types of features (for example, known
genes vs. gene predictions), or mask out unwanted features. 
<P><B>Using the DNA text formatting feature</B><BR>
To access the feature, click on the &quot;View&quot; pulldown on the top blue menu
bar on the Genome Browser page and select &quot;DNA&quot;, or select the &quot;Get DNA...&quot; option 
from the Genome Browser's <A HREF="#RIGHT_CLICK_NAV">right-click</A> menu depending on context.
&quot;The Get DNA in Window&quot; page that appears contains 
sections for configuring the retrieval and output format. 
<P>
To display extra bases upstream of the 5' end of your sequence or downstream
of the 3' end of the sequence, enter the number of bases in the corresponding
text box. This option is useful in looking for regulatory regions.
<P>
The Sequence Formatting section lists several options for
adjusting the case of all or part of the DNA sequence. To choose one of these formats,
click the corresponding option button, then click the <I>get DNA</I> button. To access a table 
of extended formatting options, click the <I>Extended case/color options</I> button. 
<P>
The Extended DNA Case/Color page presents a table with many more format options. The page
provides instructions for using the formatting table, as well as examples of its use. The
list of tracks in the Track Name column is automatically generated from the list of tracks
available on the current genome.
<P><B>Tips for Use</B><BR>
A few caveats mentioned on the Extended DNA Case/Color page bear repeating. Keep the formatting simple at first: it is easy to 
make a display that is pretty to look at but is also completely cryptic. Also, be careful when 
requesting complex formatting for a large chromosomal region: when all the HTML tags have been 
added to the output page, the file size may exceed the size limits that your internet browser, 
clipboard, and other software can safely display. The maximum size of genome that can be 
formatted by the tool is approximately 10 Mbp.

<P>Coordinates of features frequently
change from one assembly to the next as gaps are closed, strand orientations are
corrected, and duplications are reduced. Occasionally, a chunk of sequence may
be moved to an entirely different chromosome as the map is
refined. There are three different methods available for migrating data from one
assembly to another: BLAT alignment, coordinate conversion, and coordinate 
lifting. The BLAT alignment tool is described in the section 
<A HREF="#BLATAlign">Using BLAT alignments</A>.
<P><B>Coordinate conversion</B><BR>
The Genome Browser Convert utility is useful for 
locating the position of a feature of interest in a different release of the
same genome or (in some cases) in a genome assembly of another species.
During the conversion process, portions of the genome in the coordinate range 
of the original assembly are aligned to the new assembly while preserving their 
order and orientation. In general, it is easier to achieve successful 
conversions with shorter sequences. 
<P>
When coordinate conversion is available for an assembly, click on the
&quot;View&quot; pulldown on the top blue menu bar on the Genome Browser page and
select the &quot;In Other Genomes (Convert)&quot; link. You will be presented
with a list of the genome/assembly conversion options 
available for the current assembly. Select the genome and assembly to which you'd like to convert
the coordinates, then click the Submit button. If the conversion is successful,
the browser will return a list of regions in the new assembly, along with
the percent of bases and span covered by that region. Click on a region to 
display it in the browser. If the conversion is unsuccessful, the utility 
returns a failure message.

<A NAME="Liftover"></A><BR>

<P><B>Lifting coordinates</B><BR>
The liftOver tool is useful if you wish to convert a large number of 
coordinate ranges between assemblies. This tool is available in both 
web-based and command line forms, and supports forward/reverse conversions
as well as conversions between species.

<P><B>Web-based coordinate lifting</B><BR>
To access the graphical version of the liftOver tool, click on &quot;Tools&quot;
pulldown in the top blue menu bar of the Genome Browser, then select
<a class="change" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver">LiftOver</a> from the menu.
<P>
To convert one or more coordinate ranges using the default conversion settings: 
<OL>
<LI>
Select the genome and assembly from which the ranges were taken 
(&quot;Original&quot;), as well as the genome and assembly to which the 
coordinates should be converted (&quot;New&quot;). 
<LI>Select the Data Format option: 
Browser Extensible Data format (<A HREF="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED</A>) 
or position (coordinates of the form <em>chrN:start-end</em>). 
<LI>Enter coordinate ranges in the selected data format into the large text 
box, one per line.
<LI>Click Submit. 
</OL></P>
<P>
Alternatively, you may load the coordinate ranges from an existing data
file by entering the file name in the upload box at the bottom of the screen, 
then clicking the Submit File button. 
<P>
The default parameter settings are recommended for general purpose use of the
liftOver tool. However, you may want to customize settings if you have several
very large regions to convert. 
<!--
<UL>
<LI><B>Minimum ratio of bases that must remap</B> (default 0.95)<B>:</B> It may 
be beneficial to reduce this value when working with poor-quality assemblies or
cross-species conversions. For large-area conversions under these conditions,
a value as low as 0.01 may be used.
<LI><B>Minimum chain size in target</B> (default 0)<B>:</B> This parameter is 
applied only when the &quot;Allow multiple output regions&quot; option is 
checked. This setting may be increased to reduce fragmentation. For example, 
when doing large-scale conversions, we have found that a setting of 4000
worked well for this option.
<LI><B>Minimum hit size in query</B> (default 0)<B>:</B> This parameter is 
applied only when the &quot;Allow multiple output regions&quot; option is 
checked. 
<LI><B>Allow multiple output regions</B> (default off)<B>:</B> By default, 
liftOver does not return a match if the region is split in the new assembly. 
Consider checking this option for conversions involving high-quality data 
within the same species. This option should not be used when mapping large 
regions, doing cross-species conversions or using fragmented poor-quality 
assemblies.
<LI><B>Min ratio of alignment blocks/exons that must map</B> (default 1)<B>:</B>
<LI><B>If thickStart/thickEnd is not mapped, use the closest mapped bas</B>
(default off)<B>:</B>
</UL></P>
-->

<P><B>Command-line coordinate lifting</B><BR>
The command-line version of liftOver offers the increased flexibility and 
performance gained by running the tool on your local server. This utility 
requires access to a Linux platform. The executable file 
may be downloaded 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">here</A>.
Command-line liftOver requires a UCSC-generated <em>over.chain</em> file as 
input. Pre-generated files for a given assembly can be accessed from the 
assembly's &quot;LiftOver files&quot; link on the 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">Downloads</A> page. If the desired conversion file is not listed, 
send a request to the 
<A HREF="../../contacts.html">genome mailing list</A> and we may be able
to generate one for you.

<P>Most of the underlying tables containing the genomic sequence and annotation data 
displayed in the Genome Browser can be downloaded. All of the tables are
freely usable for any purpose except as indicated in the README.txt file
in the download directories. This data was contributed by many researchers, as 
listed on the Genome Browser 
<A HREF="../credits.html" TARGET=_blank>Credits</A> page. Please
acknowledge the contributor(s) of the data you use. 
<P><B>Downloading the data</B><BR>
Genome data can be downloaded in different ways:

        directories for all genome versions currently accessible in the
        Genome Browser. The rsync command
        <tt>rsync -a -P rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/path/file ./</tt>
        can quickly and efficiently download large files to your current
        directory (./). To download an entire directory (note the trailing slash),
        you would use an expression such as:
        <tt>rsync -a -P rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/directory/ ./</tt>

<I>Chromosomes</I> contains the assembled sequence for the 
genome in separate files for each chromosome in a zipped fasta format.
The main assembly can be found in the <em>chrN.fa</em> files, where <em>N</em> 
is the name of the chromosome.  The <em>chrN_random.fa</em> files contain clones
that are not yet finished or cannot be placed with certainty
at a specific place on the chromosome. In some cases, the <em>chrN_random.fa</em>
files also contain haplotypes that differ from the main assembly.
<P>
<I>Database</I> contains all of the 
positional and non-positional tables in the genome annotation database. Each 
table is represented by 2 files:
<TABLE>
	<TR><TD WIDTH="20" VALIGN="top">--</TD><TD><B>.sql file:</B>
	the MySQL commands used to create the table.

<P>
Track hubs are web-accessible directories of genomic data that can be viewed on the UCSC Genome 
Browser alongside native annotation tracks. Hubs are a useful tool for visualizing a large number 
of genome-wide data sets. The 
<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgHubConnect" TARGET=_blank>Track Hub</A> utility allows efficient 
access to data sets from around the world through the familiar Genome Browser interface. 
Browser users can display tracks from any public track hub that has been registered with UCSC. 
Additionally, users can import data from unlisted hubs or can set up, display, and share their 
own track hubs. 
</P>
<P>
For information on using the Track Hub features, refer to the 
<A HREF="hgTrackHubHelp.html">Genome Browser Track Hub User Guide</A>.
For specific information on configuring your trackDb.txt file, refer to the
<A HREF="trackDb/trackDbHub.html">Track Database Definition Document</A>.
