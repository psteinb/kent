<!-- GTF format description.  This is used in the FAQ and custom tracks documentation -->
<P>GTF (Gene Transfer Format) is a refinement to GFF that tightens the specification.
The first eight GTF fields are the same as GFF. The <I>group</I> field has been
expanded into a list of <I>attributes</I>.  Each attribute consists of a type/value pair.  Attributes
must end in a semi-colon, and be separated from any following attribute by exactly one space.
<P>
The attribute list must begin with the two mandatory attributes:
<UL>
<LI><B>gene_id <I>value</I></B> - A globally unique identifier for the genomic
source of the sequence.
<LI><B>transcript_id <I>value</I></B> - A globally unique identifier for the
predicted transcript.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Example:</I></B><BR>Here is an example of the ninth field in a GTF data line:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>gene_id "Em:U62317.C22.6.mRNA"; transcript_id "Em:U62317.C22.6.mRNA";
exon_number 1</tt>
<P>The Genome Browser groups together GTF lines that have the same
<I>transcript_id</I> value.  It only looks at features of type <I>exon</I> and 
<I>CDS</I>.</P>
