<h1>bigBed Track Format</h1> 
<p>
The bigBed format stores annotation items that can be either a simple or a linked collection of 
exons, much as <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED</a> files do. BigBed files are created
from BED type files using the program <code>bedToBigBed</code>. The resulting bigBed 
files are in an indexed binary format. The main advantage of the bigBed files is that only
those portions of the files needed to display a particular region are transferred to the Genome 
Browser server. Because of this, bigBed has considerably faster display performance than
regular BED when working with large data sets. The bigBed file remains on your local web-accessible 
server (http, https, or ftp), not on the UCSC server, and only the portion that is needed for the 
currently displayed chromosomal position is locally cached as a "sparse file".</p>
<p>
Additional indices can be created for the items in a bigBed file to support item search in track 
hubs. See <a href="#Ex3">Example #3</a> below for an example of how to build an additional 
index.</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Selecting_a_graphing_track_data_format" 
target="_blank">this wiki page</a> for help in selecting the graphing track data format that is most
appropriate for your type of data.</p>
<p>
Note that the <code>bedToBigBed</code> utility uses a substantial amount of memory:
approximately 25% more RAM than the uncompressed BED input file.</p>
<p>

<h2>Creating a bigBed track</h2>
<p>
To create a bigBed track, follow these steps:<p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1.</strong>
Create a BED format file following the directions 
<a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">here</a>. When converting a BED file to a bigBed file, 
you are limited to one track of data in your input file; therefore, you must create a separate BED 
file for each data track. Your BED file must be sorted first on the <code>chrom</code> field, and 
secondarily on the <code>chromStart</code> field. You can use the following UNIX <code>sort</code> 
command to do this: </p>
<pre><code>sort -k1,1 -k2,2n unsorted.bed &gt; input.bed</code></pre>
<p> 
<strong>Step 2.</strong>
Remove any existing &quot;track&quot; or &quot;browser&quot; lines from your BED file so that it 
contains only data.</p>
<p> 
<strong>Step 3.</strong>
Download the <code>bedToBigBed</code> program from the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">binary utilities directory</a>.</p>
<p> 
<strong>Step 4.</strong>
Use the <code>fetchChromSizes</code> script from the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">same directory</a> 
to create the <em>chrom.sizes</em> file for the UCSC database you are working with (e.g., hg19).</p>
<p> 
<strong>Step 5.</strong>
Use the <code>bedToBigBed</code> utility to create a bigBed file from your sorted BED file, using 
the <em>input.bed</em> file and <em>chrom.sizes</em> files created in <em>Steps 1</em> and
<em>4</em>:</p> 
<pre><code><strong>bedToBigBed</strong> input.bed chrom.sizes myBigBed.bb</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>Step 6.</strong>
Move the newly created bigBed file (<em>myBigBed.bb</em>) to a web-accessible http, https, or 
ftp location.</p>
<p> 
<strong>Step 7.</strong>
If the file name ends with a <em>.bigBed</em> or <em>.bb</em> suffix, you can paste the URL of the 
file directly into the 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">custom track</a> management page, click &quot;submit&quot; and 
view the file as a track in the Genome Browser. By default, the file name will be used to name the track. To configure the track 
name and descriptions, you must create a &quot;<a href="hgTracksHelp.html#TRACK">track 
line</a>&quot;, as shown in <em>Step 8</em>.</p>
<p> 
<strong>Step 8.</strong>
Construct a <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom track</a> using a single track line. 
Note that any of the track attributes listed
<a href="customTrack.html#TRACK">here</a> are applicable to tracks of type bigBed. The most basic 
version of the track line will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><strong>track type=</strong>bigBed <strong>name=</strong>"My Big Bed" <strong>description=</strong>"A Graph of Data from My Lab" <strong>bigDataUrl=</strong>http://myorg.edu/mylab/myBigBed.bb</code></pre>
<p> 
Paste this custom track line into the text box on the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">custom 
track</a> management page.</p>
<p>
The <code>bedToBigBed</code> program can be run with several additional options. Some of these,
such as the <code>-as</code> and <code>-type</code> options, are used in examples below. For a full 
list of the available options, type <code>bedToBigBed</code> (with no arguments) on the command line
to display the usage message.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Example #1</h3>
<p>
In this example, you will create a bigBed custom track using an existing bigBed file,
<em>bigBedExample.bb</em>, on the UCSC http server. This file contains chromosome 21 data on the 
human hg19 assembly.</p>
<p>
To create a custom track using this bigBed file:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Paste the URL <code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/bigBedExample.bb</code> into 
  the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">custom track</a> management page for the human assembly 
  hg19 (Feb.  2009).</li> 
  <li>
  Click the &quot;submit&quot; button. </li>
  <li>
  On the next page that displays, click the &quot;chr21&quot; link in the custom track listing to 
  view the bigBed track in the Genome Browser. </li>
</ol>
<p>
Alternatively, you can customize the track display by including track and browser lines that define 
certain parameters: </p>
<ol>
  <li> 
  Construct a track line that references the <em>bigBedExample.bb</em> file:
<pre><code>track type=bigBed name=&quot;bigBed Example One&quot; description=&quot;A bigBed file&quot; bigDataUrl=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/bigBedExample.bb</code></pre></li>
  <li>
  Include the following browser line to ensure that the custom track opens at the correct 
  position:
  <pre><code>browser position chr21:33,031,597-33,041,570</code></pre></li>
  <li>
  Paste the browser and track lines into the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">custom track</a> 
  management page, click the &quot;submit&quot; button, then click the &quot;chr21&quot; link in the
  custom track listing to view the bigBed track in the Genome Browser.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example #2</h3>
<p>
In this example, you will create your own bigBed file from an existing bed file.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
  Save the BED file <a href="examples/bedExample.txt"><em>bedExample.txt</em></a> to your computer 
  (<em>Steps 1</em> and <em>2</em> in <em>Creating a bigBed track</em>, above).</li>  
  <li> 
  Save the file <a href="hg19.chrom.sizes"><em>hg19.chrom.sizes</em></a> to your computer. It 
  contains the chrom.sizes data for the human (hg19) assembly (<em>Step 4</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Download the <code>bedToBigBed</code> utility (<em>Step 3</em>, above).</li> 
  <li> 
  Run the utility to create the bigBed output file (<em>Step 5</em>, above):
<pre><code><strong>bedToBigBed</strong> bedExample.txt hg19.chrom.sizes myBigBed.bb</code></pre></li>
  <li> 
  Place the bigBed file you just created (<em>myBigBed.bb</em>) on a web-accessible server 
  (<em>Step 6</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Paste the URL itself into the Custom Tracks entry form or construct a track line that 
  points to your bigBed file (<em>Step 7</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Create the custom track on the human assembly hg19 (Feb. 2009), and view it in the Genome Browser 
  (<em>Step 8</em>, above). Note that the original BED file contains data on chromosome 21 
  only.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example #3</h3>
<p>
In this example, you will create your own bigBed file from a fully featured existing BED file that 
contains the standard BED fields up to and including the <em>color</em> field (field 9), plus two 
additional non-standard fields (two alternate names for each item in the file). BigBed files can 
store extra fields in addition to the <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">predefined BED 
fields</a>. If you add extra fields to your bigBed file, you must include an AutoSql format
(<em>.as</em>) file describing the fields. For more information on AutoSql, see 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5949" target="_blank">Kent and Brumbaugh, 2002</a>, as 
well as examples of <em>.as</em> files in 
<a href="http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/unzipped/hg/lib/">this directory</a>. 
This example also demonstrates how to create extra indices on the name field, and the first of the 
extra fields to be used for track item search.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
  Save the BED file <a href="examples/bedExample2.bed"><em>bedExample2.bed</em></a> to your computer
  (<em>Steps 1</em> and <em>2</em> in <em>Creating a bigBed track</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Save the file <a href="hg18.chrom.sizes"><em>hg18.chrom.sizes</em></a> to your computer. This file
  contains the chrom.sizes for the human (hg18) assembly (<em>Step 4</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Save the AutoSql file <a href="examples/bedExample2.as"><em>bedExample2.as</em></a> to your 
  computer. This file contains descriptions of the BED fields, and is required when the BED file 
  contains a <em>color</em> field.</li>  
  <li> 
  Download the <code>bedToBigBed</code> utility (<em>Step 3</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Run the utility to create a bigBed output file with an index on the name field and the first 
  extra field: (<em>Step 5</em>, above):
  <pre><code>bedToBigBed -as=bedExample2.as -type=bed9+2 -extraIndex=name,geneSymbol bedExample2.bed hg18.chrom.sizes myBigBed2.bb</code></pre></li>
  <li> 
  Place the bigBed file you just created (<em>myBigBed2.bb</em>) on a web-accessible server 
  (<em>Step 6</em>, above).</li>
  <li> 
  Paste the URL of the file into the custom tracks entry form, or alternatively construct a track 
  line that points to your bigBed file (<em>Step 7</em>, above). Because this bigBed file includes a
  field for color, you must include the 
  <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1"><code>itemRgb</code></a> attribute in the track line. 
  It will look somewhat similar to this (note that you must insert the URL specific to your own 
  bigBed file):
  <pre><code>track type=bigBed name="bigBed Example Three" description="A bigBed File with Color and two Extra Fields" itemRgb="On" bigDataUrl=http://yourWebAddress/myBigBed2.bb</code></pre></li>
  <li> 
  Create the custom track on the human assembly hg18 (Mar. 2006), and view it in the Genome Browser 
  (<em>step 8</em>, above). Note that the original BED file contains data on chromosome 7 only.</li>
  <li> 
  If you are using the bigBed file in a track hub, you can use the additional indices for track
  item searches. See the setting &quot;searchIndex&quot; in the 
  <a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#searchIndex">Track Database Definition Document</a> for more 
  information. For example, if you run the <code>bedToBigBed</code> utility with the option 
  <code>-extraIndex=name</code>, you will be able to search on the &quot;name&quot; field by adding 
  the line <code>searchIndex name</code> to the stanza about your bigBed in the hub's 
  <em>trackDb.txt</em> file.</li>
  <li>
  Extra fields can contain text for labels or for display with mouseover (if the BED
  &quot;name&quot; field is needed for something that is not the label). See the trackDb settings 
  &quot;<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#mouseOverField">mouseOverField</a>&quot; and 
  &quot;<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#labelField">labelField</a>&quot; for more information.</li>
  <li>
  When you click on features, the contents of all extra fields are shown as a table. You can modify 
  the layout of the resulting page with the trackDb settings 
  &quot;<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#skipFields">skipFields</a>&quot;, 
  &quot;<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#sepFields">sepFields</a>&quot; 
  and &quot;<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#skipEmptyFields">skipEmptyFields</a>&quot;, and 
  transform text fields into links with the 
  &quot;<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#urls">urls</a>&quot; trackDb setting.</li>
  <li>
  Extra fields that start with the character &quot;_&quot; are reserved for internal use (special 
  display code); their contents are not shown on the details page.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sharing Your Data with Others</h2>
<p>
If you would like to share your bigBed data track with a colleague, learn how to create a URL by 
looking at Example #11 on <a href="customTrack.html#EXAMPLE11">this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Extracting Data from the bigBed Format</h2>
<p>
Because the bigBed files are indexed binary files, it can be difficult to extract data from them. 
UCSC has developed the following programs to assist in working with bigBed formats, available from 
the <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">binary utilities directory</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <code>bigBedToBed</code> &mdash; converts a bigBed file to ASCII BED format.</li>
  <li>
  <code>bigBedSummary</code> &mdash; extracts summary information from a bigBed file.</li>
  <li>
  <code>bigBedInfo</code> &mdash; prints out information about a bigBed file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These programs accept either file names or URLs to files as input. As with all UCSC 
Genome Browser programs, simply type the program name (with no parameters) on the command line to 
view the usage statement.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
If you get an error when you run the <code>bedToBigBed</code> program, check your input BED file for
data coordinates that extend past the end of the chromosome. If these are present, run the 
<code>bedClip</code> program
(<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">available here</a>) to remove the problematic 
row(s) in your input BED file before using the <code>bedToBigBed</code> program.
