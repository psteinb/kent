    <div class="sectionContent">

                <p>
                Genome-euro is an official European mirror site of the UCSC Genome Browser, located at
                <a href="http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu</a>.
                The server is physically located at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld
                <a href="http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/" target="_blank">
                Center for Biotechnology</a> in Bielefeld, Germany, and is administered by UCSC.
                Genome-euro is meant to be an alternate, faster access point for those Browser users
                who are geographically closer to central Europe than to the western United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                When European users navigate to the U.S. server (and conversely, when U.S. users navigate to
                the European server) and click the "Genomes" or "Genome Browser" menu item, they will receive
                a notification at the top of the window that they have been redirected to the more
                geographically-appropriate server.  At this point, one of two things can happen:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>The user can choose to remain on the redirected server and proceed normally.</li>
                  <li>The user can click the provided link back to the original server. When this occurs, a
                      cookie is created in the user's Internet browser remembering this choice and in the
                      future, no automatic redirection will occur.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                The user may also manually select a server at any time by mousing over the "Mirrors" menu item,
                illustrated below.  Note that manually selecting a server will also create a cookie that will
                disable automatic redirection. Automatic redirection can be re-enabled by clearing cookies.
                </p>

                Many thanks to the folks at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld
                <a href="http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/" target="_blank">Center for Biotechnology</a>
                for hosting this server.
                </p>
