<B>Name</B> - a hyperlink to the update page where you can edit your 
track data.</LI>
<LI> 
<B>Description</B> - the value of the &quot;description&quot; 
attribute from the track line, if present. If no description is included 
in the input file, this field contains the track name.</LI>
<LI> 
<B>Type</B> - the track type, determined by the Browser based on the format 
of the data.</LI>
<LI> 
<B>Doc</B> - displays &quot;Y&quot; (Yes) if a description page has been 
uploaded for the track; otherwise the field is blank.</LI>
<LI> 
<B>Items</B> - the number of data items in the custom track file. An item
count is not displayed for tracks lacking individual items (e.g. wiggle format 
data).</LI>
<LI> 
<B>Pos</B> - the default chromosomal position defined by the track file in
either the browser line &quot;position&quot; attribute or the first data line.
Clicking this link opens the Genome Browser or Table Browser at the
specified position (note: only the chromosome name is shown in this column). 
The Pos column remains blank if the track lacks individual items 
(e.g. wiggle format data) and the browser line &quot;position&quot; attribute 
hasn't been set.</LI>
