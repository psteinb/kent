<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows restriction enzyme recognition sites. At different browser
zoom levels (categorized in the table below by the number of bases visible), 
different sets of enzymes are shown. &quot;Base-level&quot; refers to the 
browser zoom level at which individual bases are displayed in the Base 
Position track. Displays of custom enzyme sets override the table: in these 
cases, the restriction sites are consistent across all zoom 
levels. "Primary" enzymes are the canonical isoschizomer for each 
cutsite, usually the first isolated or most readily available. </P>
<P>
The base-level display shows the detail of the cutting pattern of the enzyme as 
well as the presence of any ambiguous or redundant nucleotides in the cutsite.  
The four standard bases, G, A, T and C, are displayed in black, whereas non-unique
bases using 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/iupac.html">IUPAC</A>
designations (R, Y, N, etc) are displayed in blue.</P>
<P>
The term &quot;isoligamer&quot; in the enzyme details section 
was coined to designate enzymes that produce
single-stranded overhanging &quot;sticky&quot; ends that are ligatable to 
each other. </P>
