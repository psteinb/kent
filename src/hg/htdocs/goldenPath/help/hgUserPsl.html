<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the BLAT alignments of your sequence(s) to the genome
assembly.  In the Genome Browser, alignments of nucleotides use color
to highlight differences as follows:

<UL>
<LI><FONT color="red"><B>red:</B></FONT> Genome and query sequence have 
different bases at this position.</LI>
<LI><FONT color="orange"><B>orange:</B></FONT> The query sequence has an 
insertion (or genome has a deletion / alignment gap) at this point.</LI>
<LI><FONT color="#9214FF"><B>purple:</B></FONT> The query sequence extends 
beyond the end of the alignment.</LI>
<LI><FONT color="green"><B>green:</B></FONT> The query sequence appears to 
have a polyA tail which is not aligned to the genome.</LI>
</UL>

Also, when the alignment has gaps for both genome and query sequence, 
double horizontal lines are drawn.
