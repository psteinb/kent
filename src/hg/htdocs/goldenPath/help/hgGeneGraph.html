<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Pathways and Gene Interactions graph accompanies the &quot;Protein Interactions&quot;
track and displays a detailed gene interaction and pathway graph based on data
collected from two sources: curated pathway/protein-interaction databases and
interactions found through text mining of PubMed abstracts.
</p>

<p>
The curated data were imported from 23 pathway or protein-interaction database
(see Methods section below). Curators at these databases typically read
research articles, collect protein interactions from them and store them in a
web-accessible database. Pathway databases such as Reactome or WikiPathways
describe a whole set of interactions, e.g. the WNT pathway, and the type of 
effect, and sometimes annotate indirect or inferred effects with a physical
interaction. They often work from review articles. In contrast, protein
interaction databases focus more on the original literature that describes the
results of the biochemical protein-interaction experiments and focus less on
the effect or direction of the interaction.
</p>

<p>
The text mining data was generated in collaboration with the <a href='https://hanover.azurewebsites.net'
target="_blank">Microsoft Research Project Hanover Team</a> using
<a href="https://literome.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank">Literome machine-reading</a>.
Literome is a natural-language processing (NLP) system that analyzes sentences and tries to
extract names of proteins and the type of interaction. A simple example is a
sentence such as, &quot;PTEN negatively regulates AKT3&quot;, which gets transformed to
&quot;PTEN-AKT3&quot; and &quot;regulation: negative&quot;. The text mining system was run on all
20 million <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/' target="_blank">PubMed</a> abstracts at the end
of 2014 and can also be queried through the website
<a href='http://literome.azurewebsites.net/' target="_blank">Literome</a>.

<h2>Configuring the Pathway and Gene Interaction Display</h2>

<p>
Clicking on an item in the track display takes you to a page that includes a gene
interaction graph with detailed information on the directionality and support
for the various interactions displayed. The graph is initially centered on the
gene clicked in the track display, with this gene highlighted in
yellow. [image here?] By default, only the top 25 best supported interactions
are displayed, but this number can be increased, decreased or filtered using
the controls above the image. The interaction display can be filtered using
the drop-down menu to display subsets by their support:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All interactions, regardless of support type</li>
<li>Curated interactions only</li>
<li>Interactions present in a database, manually curated or not</li>
</ul>

<p>
Genes in the interaction graph are connected by a number different types of
lines, with each type of line and the line properties themselves indicating
different levels of support from text mining and databases. [image here?]
</p>

<ul>
<li>Solid grey lines - only text-mining support for this interaction, with the thickness of the
line indicating the number of articles supporting it.</li>
<li>Dashed blue lines - at least one curated database supports this interaction.
<ul>
<li> dark blue - the information is derived from a paper describing less than 10 interactions</li>
<li> light blue - the information is derived from a high-throughput paper, describing more than 10
interactions, e.g. a complex or a mass-spec study</li>
</ul>
<li>Solid blue lines - both databases and text mining support this interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lines may include arrows showing the directionality of this interaction. In
these cases, the directionality is determined by majority support. For example,
imagine an interaction between protein A and protein B; two articles support
that A acts on B while a single article supports the opposite, B acting on A.
In this case, because there are more articles supporting A acting on B, then the
arrow will be drawn such that it starts at A and points to B.
</p>

<p>
From the &quot;Annotate Genes&quot; drop-down, you can annotate genes based on GNF2
average expression, drugability from <a href='https://www.drugbank.ca/' target="_blank">DrugBank</a>
entries, cancer type in the <a href='http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/'
target="_blank">COSMIC Cancer Gene Census</a>, and the number of non-silent
mutations identified by the <a href='http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n10/full/ng.2764.html'
target="_blank">PanCancer analysis
project</a>. For the
GNF2 expression and PanCancer Mutation coloring, genes will be colored on a
sliding scale from light grey to black, with those items with the highest
expression or the largest number of non-silent mutations being colored the
darkest and those with lower expression or fewer mutations being colored grey.
Genes will be colored dark blue if there is no information in the database.

</p>

<p>
You can mouse-over items in the display to show more details about the gene
such as their product. [image here?] If you've chosen to annotate genes with
one of the various databases, then it will display that information as well.
You can mouse-over the connecting lines between genes to see more details about
the evidence that supports this connection. [image here?] If you click on the
line connecting two proteins, you can see a
<a href='http://www4.ncsu.edu/~mbcusick/papers/nenkova2005impact.pdf'
target="_blank">SumBasic</a>-selected
snippet of text from a Pubmed abstract and, if it is a curated interaction, the
supporting information from the pathway or interaction databases.
</p>

<p>
Below the graph of gene interactions and pathways, there is table of less
supported interactions. These are interactions which were mentioned only a few
times each in the literature. [image here?] The numbers shown on mouse-over for
each interaction represents the number of articles and number of databases that
support this interaction.
</p>

<p>
You can export the currently displayed gene interaction graph in a variety of formats
including PDF, SVG, Cytoscape, and JSON. 
</p>

<p>
The gene interaction graph can be recentered around a new gene in a
few different ways: (1) clicking a gene in the existing interaction graph, (2)
clicking the triangle next to a gene in the table of minor interactions below
the graph, (3) searching for a gene name in the search box above the graph.

<p>
PubMed abstracts were downloaded from the National Library of Medicine (NLM)
website. The abstracts were then
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(lexical_analysis)' target="_blank">tokenized</a> and
parsed syntactically using the <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/msr-splat/'
target="_blank">SPLAT toolkit</a>. Protein
and Gene names were identified and normalized after which potential
interactions were extracted using the MSR &quot;Protein and Pathway Extractors&quot;. The
results were then mapped to the genome using their HGNC gene symbols.
