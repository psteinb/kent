<h2>Jan. 05, 2018 &nbsp;&nbsp; New mappability data for human, hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new set of annotations from the
<a href="https://hoffmanlab.org/" target="_blank">Hoffman Lab</a> that contains mappability data for
both the reference genome and bisulfite-converted genome of
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg38" target="_blank">hg38/GRCh38</a>. These tracks indicate
regions with uniquely mappable reads of particular lengths before and after bisulfite conversion.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=mappability" target="_blank">Mappability</a>
supertrack contains two composite tracks, <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=mappability"
target="_blank">Bismap</a> and <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=mappability"
target="_blank">Umap</a>. Both Umap and Bismap tracks contain single-read and multi-read mappability
tracks for four different read lengths: 24 bp, 36 bp, 50 bp, and 100 bp. You can use these tracks
for many purposes, including filtering unreliable signal from sequencing assays. The Bismap track
can help filter unreliable signal from sequencing assays involving bisulfite conversion, such as
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing.</p>

<p>
For greater detail and explanatory diagrams, see the
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/20/095463" target="_blank">preprint</a>,
the <a href="http://bismap.hoffmanlab.org/" target="_blank">Umap and Bismap project website</a>,
or the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hoffmanlab/umap" target="_blank">Umap and Bismap software
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/"
target="_blank">Anshul Kundaje</a> (Stanford University) who created the original Umap software in
MATLAB and Mehran Karimzadeh (<a href="https://hoffmanlab.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hoffman
lab</a>, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre) who implemented the Python version of Umap and added
features, including Bismap. Thanks to Hiram Clawson, Chris Eisenhart, and Jairo Navarro of the UCSC
Genome Browser.

<h2>Dec. 13, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New NCBI RefSeq Functional Elements tracks for human and mouse</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new set of 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/functionalelements/" target="_blank">functional
regulatory elements</a> for the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=refSeqFuncElems"
target="_blank">hg38/GRCh38</a> and <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=refSeqFuncElems"
target="_blank">mm10/GRCm38</a> assemblies. NCBI is now providing
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" target="_blank">RefSeq</a> and
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/" target="_blank">Gene</a> records for non-genic
functional elements that have been described in the literature and are experimentally validated.
Elements in scope include experimentally-verified gene regulatory regions, known structural
elements, well-characterized DNA replication origins, and clinically-significant sites of DNA
recombination and genomic instability.</p>
<p>
Functional elements are colored by <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/"
                                      target=_blank>Sequence Ontology (SO)</a> term

<h2>Dec. 11, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp;New bigNarrowPeak track format</h2>
<p>
We're happy to announce support for a new binary indexed track type called
<a href="help/bigNarrowPeak.html">bigNarrowPeak</a>. This new track type joins
the ranks of other recent &quot;big&quot; track types: bigMaf, bigChain, bigPsl,
bigBarChart and bigGenePred</p>
<p>
With bigNarrowPeak, any narrowPeak files that were previously already made into bigBeds
in the past with the bedToBigBed utility and the proper narrowPeak.as definitions should
now display just as though they were narrowPeak custom tracks. For example here is a file
from the ENCODE 2012 AWG Hub that can be pasted into the
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom?db=hg19" target="_blank">Custom Tracks page</a> with
<code>type=bigNarrowPeak</code> instead of <code>type=bigBed</code> used previously:</p>
<pre><code>track type=bigNarrowPeak visibility=full db=hg19 name="nPk" description="AWG ENCODE narrowPeak Example" bigDataUrl=http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/peaks/jan2011/spp/optimal/hub/spp.optimal.wgEncodeOpenChromChipGm12878Pol2AlnRep0_VS_wgEncodeOpenChromChipGm12878InputAln.bb
</pre></code>
<p>
These tracks also support additional filter options for their additional fields,
see more with this illustrated <a href="help/bigNarrowPeak.html#example3">example</a>.</p>

<h2>Dec. 8, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp;BLAT directly from the search box</h2>
<p>
Did you know you could BLAT from the search box?</p>
<p>
If you have short sequences (less than 2000 characters) you can directly search
for them when Browsing without first visiting the BLAT tool to input the sequence.
You can <a href ="#050417">also output your BLAT results as a custom track</a>,
giving the results a name and description, and then save special results into Sessions
allowing you to return to those findings when you wish to see them at a later date.</p>

<h2>Nov. 21, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New NCBI RefSeq tracks for mouse, mm10</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new set of gene annotation tracks for the mm10/GRCm38
assembly based on data from NCBI's Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq). For all of these tracks,
the alignments and coordinates are provided by RefSeq. These tracks are organized in a composite
track that includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RefSeq All &ndash; all annotations from the curated and predicted sets
  <li>RefSeq Curated &ndash; curated annotations beginning with NM, NR, or NP
  <li>RefSeq Predicted &ndash; predicted annotations beginning with XM or XR
  <li>RefSeq Other &ndash; all other RefSeq annotations not included in RefSeq All
  <li>RefSeq Alignments &ndash; alignments of transcripts to the genome provided by RefSeq
</ul>
<p>
The new composite track also includes a &quot;UCSC RefSeq&quot; track that is based on our original
&quot;RefSeq Genes&quot; track. As with before, this UCSC track is a result of our realignments
of RefSeq RNAs to the genome, which means that there may be some cases where the annotations
differ from those in the new NCBI RefSeq tracks.</p>
<p>
More details about these tracks, their construction, and how to access their underlying data
can be found on
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/blog/the-new-ncbi-refseq-tracks-and-you/"
target="_blank">this blog</a>
or the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=refSeqComposite">track description page</a>.</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to Terence Murphy from the RefSeq group and to Hiram Clawson, Brian Raney,
Mark Diekhans, Angie Hinrichs, Jairo Navarro and many others from the UCSC Genome Browser staff for
bringing this track to life.</p>

<h2>Oct. 18, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New GTEx eQTL 44 tissues and summary tracks on hg19</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce two new GTEx eQTL tracks in the GRCh37/hg19 browser within 
the &quot;Regulation&quot; track category. These tracks show genetic variants associated with and
likely causal for differences in gene expression in 44 human tissues from the 
<a href="https://www.genome.gov/27543767/" target="_blank">Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)</a> 
V6 data release. The data items displayed are gene expression quantitative trait loci within 1MB 
of gene transcription start sites (cis-eQTLs), significantly associated with gene expression and 
in the credible set of variants for the gene at a high confidence level (95%).</p>

<p>
<b><a href="../cgi-bin/hgGtexTrackSettings?db=hg19&g=gtexEqtlCluster"
target="_blank">hg19: GTEx Combined eQTL</a></b></br>
This "all in one" track displays all cis-eQTL's from the 44 tissues, collapsed into a single track
for a summary view in the browser display. Gene/variant pairs occurring in multiple tissues are
combined into a single item in the display. The item label shows the number of tissues where the
eQTL was identified, or the tissue name and the GTEx-convention tissue color if the eQTL was
identified solely in one tissue. Mouseover lists all tissues affected and the effect size. The item
color reflects the largest effect size in any tissue (red for positive, blue for negative).
Click-through on a combined eQTL shows for each tissue the significance of the association, effect
size on gene expression, and the probability the eQTL belongs to the the 95% credible set. Track
configuration supports filtering by gene, effect size, or probability. Tissues can be selected via
checkboxes or from the UCSC GTEx Body Map graphic. </p>

<p>
<b><a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=gtexEqtlTissue" target="_blank">hg19: GTEx Tissue eQTL
</a></b></br>This track is a composite track containing 44 subtracks representing the GTEx eQTL 
tissues. Each subtrack contains all eQTLs identified for that tissue. Filtering is available for 
all 44 subtracks.</p>

<h2>Sep. 29, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; VAI tool can now output HGVS terms</h2>
<p>
The UCSC Genome Browser has <a href="help/query.html#HGVS" target="_blank">continued to expand</a>
the support for Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature. We have recently enhanced our
<a href="/cgi-bin/hgVai" target="_blank">Variant Annotation Integrator (VAI) tool</a> to allow 
output of HGVS terms from inputed variants when the gene prediction source is set to annotate on 
RefSeq genes.</p>
<p>
For a quick experience click the &quot;Get results&quot; button in this
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgVai?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=brianlee&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg38.exampleVAI"
target="_blank">example session</a>. This session is loaded with an artifical input of variants
on the human hg38 assembly with NCBI RefSeq Genes track (curated NM_*, NR_*, and YP_* subset)
filtered for coding exons and splice site roles and on DNase regulatory elements with output
in HTML Variant Effect Predictor format where the &quot;Extra&quot; column will include
HGVS notation. Please note that a semi-colon &quot;;&quot; will separate results in
that field (HGVSG=NC_000010.11:g.27005592_27005594delAGA;

<h2>Sep. 19, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; Data Integrator video released</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new <a href =
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=8ATcoDTOc0g&list=UUQnUJepyNOw0p8s2otX4RYQ"
target = _blank>video</a> to the UCSC Genome Browser <a href =
"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQnUJepyNOw0p8s2otX4RYQ/videos"
target = _blank>YouTube channel</a>.  This video demonstrates the Data Integrator,
a tool that allows data from up to five primary table to be exported.  The tables
do not have to share a common data field, but are intersected using the
coordinate footprint of the annotations in the first selected dataset.</p>

<p>For example, even though the variants in the Common SNPs table share no
identifiers with the genes in the UCSC Genes track of the human genome assembly
hg19, it is possible to export a list of genes and all the Common SNPs that map
to the chosen set of genes.  This functionality extends the reach of data mining
beyond what is possible with the Table Browser.</p>

<h2>Sep. 12, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; GTEx Transcript Expression tracks now available for human</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of the GTEx Transcript Expression track available on the two
most recent human assemblies, <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=gtexTranscExpr"
target="_blank">GRCh38/hg38</a> and <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=gtexTranscExpr"
target="_blank">GRCh37/hg19</a>. This track provides additional analysis of the same data as the
existing GTEx Gene track and displays median transcript expression levels in 53 tissues, based on
RNA-seq data from the GTEx midpoint milestone data release (V6, October 2015).
Data for this track were computed at UCSC from GTEx RNA-seq sequence data using the
<a href="http://toil.ucsc-cgl.org/" target="_blank">Toil</a> pipeline running the kallisto
transcript-level quantification tool.</p>
<p>
The data in the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=gtexTranscExpr"
target="_blank">GRCh37/hg19</a> version of this track was generated by coordinate converting the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=gtexTranscExpr" target="_blank">GRCh38/hg38</a>
track data. Of the 189,615 BED entries from the original hg38 track, 176,220 were mapped
over by transcript name to hg19 using wgEncodeGencodeCompV24lift37 (~93% coverage).
</p>
<p>
Samples were collected by the GTEx Consortium. RNA-seq was performed by the GTEx Laboratory, Data
Analysis and Coordinating Center (LDACC) at the Broad Institute. John Vivian, Melissa Cline, and
Benedict Paten of the UCSC Computational Genomics lab were responsible for the sequence read
quantification used to produce this track. Thanks to Kate Rosenbloom, Chris Eisenhart, and Jairo
Navarro of the UCSC Genome Browser group for their work in creating and releasing these tracks.</p>

<h2>Aug. 23, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New dbSNP build 150 tracks now available for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of our &quot;SNP&quot; tracks derived from
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank"> NCBI&#39;s dbSNP Human Build 150 
data</a>, available on the two most recent human assemblies, 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=snp150" target="_blank">GRCh38/hg38</a> and 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=snp150" target="_blank">GRCh37/hg19</a>.
NCBI's dbSNP database is a collection which includes a range of molecular variation, such as single 
nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions (indels). This release 
<a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/05/08/dbsnps-human-build-150-has-
doubled-the-amount-of-refsnp-records/" target="_blank">
nearly doubles</a> the number of SNP records compared to the previous 147 release (now over 300
million for hg38, and over 200 million for hg19). </p>

<p>
There are four SNP tracks available as part of this release:
<ul>
 <li>
All SNPs (150): containing all mappings of reference SNPs to the human assembly. The tracks below
are subsets of <i>All SNPs (150)</i>.</li>
<li>
Common SNPs (150): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or are
100% non-reference.</li>
<li>
Flagged SNPs (150): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by dbSNP
as &quot;clinically associated.&quot;</li>
<li>
Mult. SNPs (150): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location. This track has
been shrinking over the course of the last few releases as dbSNP now excludes most SNPs whose
flanking sequences map to multiple locations in the genome.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the <i>Common SNPs (150)</i> are visible in the browser; other tracks must be made
visible using the track controls. <i>All SNPs (150)</i> tracks reside in the &quot;Variation&quot;
group category for the hg19 and hg38 browsers.</p>
<p>
These tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and checked for quality by Cath Tyner. 
We'd like to thank the dbSNP group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>

<h2>Aug. 17, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New CRISPR track for Chinese hamster</h2>
<p>
A new <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=criGri1&g=crispr" target="_blank">CRISPR/Cas9</a> track is 
now available for the Chinese hamster (C_griseus_v1.0/<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=criGri1"
target="_blank">criGri1</a>) assembly.</p>
<p>
This track shows regions of the genome within 200 bp of transcribed regions and DNA sequences 
targetable by CRISPR RNA guides using the Cas9 enzyme from S. pyogenes (PAM: NGG). CRISPR target 
sites were annotated with predicted specificity (off-target effects) and predicted efficiency 
(on-target cleavage) by various algorithms using the <a href="http://crispor.tefor.net/"
target="_blank">CRISPOR</a> tool.</p>
<p>
The details page for each target contains a wealth of information related to the target, such as the
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2647" target="_blank">MIT Specificity score</a>, 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3543"

<h2>Jul. 14, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New alternative mouse strain hub and strain-specific annotations</h3>
<p>
A mouse strain assembly hub is now available and shows an alignment of 16 assembled laboratory mice
strains, including the reference mouse (mm10) as well as the reference rat (rn6). This hub contains
some of the most common mice strains used in disease models such as NOD, BALB/c, and C3H. Each
mouse strain in the assembly hub is displayed as the primary sequence along with strain-specific
annotations. You can load this hub from our <a href="../cgi-bin/hgHubConnect"
target="_blank">Public Hubs</a> or the following
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/hubs/mouseStrains/hubIndex.html" target="_blank">page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Along with the release of this assembly hub, a new track is available for mm10. The
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=strainSNPs" target="_blank">Mouse SNPs</a> track shows
single nucleotide variants between the different strains of mice and all SNP and indel calls are
relative to the reference mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10).</p>
<p>
Special thanks to Joel Armstrong, Ian Fiddles, and Benedict Paten for the alignment generation, as
well as Thomas Keane and the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project"
target="_blank">Mouse Genomes Project</a> for providing the genome assemblies. Thanks to Hiram 
Clawson and Jairo Navarro for the development and release of this track and hub.</p>

<h2>Jul. 14, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Video:  Multi-Region mode for viewing 
discontinuous regions in the Browser</h2>
<p>
Today we release a new <a href = "https://goo.gl/gQTcyR" target = _blank>video</a> 
showing how to use the enhanced Multi-Region display mode.  This feature allows 
the display of any regions of the genome together on the same screen.  A recent 
enhancement of the feature allows users to load their coordinates directly into 
a text box, bypassing the previous requirement to use a URL to upload coordinates.
</p>
<p>
This completes a trilogy of videos demonstrating the Multi-Region mode.  Previous 
episodes showed how to use <a href = "https://goo.gl/n8szK2" target = _blank>Exon-Only 
mode</a> and how to view <a href = "https://goo.gl/99tX3Y" target = _blank>alternate 
haplotypes</a> in their chromosomal context.
</p>
<p>
This video, like the other content in this series, is annotated in
our <a href = "../training/vids/" target = _blank>training pages</a> with an 
index showing the steps, with links directly to the corresponding places in the 
video.  There is also a <a 
href = "http://genome.ucsc.edu/training/vids/transcript11.pdf" 
target = _blank>transcript</a>.
</p>
<p>
The videos were produced at UCSC by Robert Kuhn and David Gibson.
The Multi-Region engineering was by Galt Barber.

<h2>Jun. 22, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; Visualize gene pathways and interactions</h2>
<p>
Individual genes do not exist in a vacuum and their expression, activation, and function
are often dependent on their interactions with other genes, frequently as part of pathways or 
complexes. The new &quot;Gene Interactions&quot; tool combines data from a number of 
<a href="help/hgGeneGraph.html#methods" target="_blank">curated interaction and
pathway databases</a> as well as interactions mined from over 20 million PubMed abstracts
through the <a href="http://literome.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Literome</a> project.
<p><img class='text-center' src="../../images/hgGeneGraph.png" alt="Gene Interaction Graph"
width="35%" height="35%"></p>

<p>
This new tool displays a detailed pathway and interaction graph for a selected gene, marked
in yellow. This primary gene is connected by lines to other genes, with those displayed
representing the interactions with the most support from both text mining and databases.
You can hover over any gene in the image to see more details about its
product; you can hover over the connecting lines to see more detailed information about the data
supporting a particular interaction. Clicking on one of these interaction lines brings you to a
page that provides links to supporting information. Interactions can be filtered based on
various support levels (both text-mined and databases, all databases, curated-only databases);
and genes can be annotated and colored according to a variety of properties (GNF2 average
expression, DrugBank and more.) You can read more about this tool and its features on the 
<a href="help/hgGeneGraph.html" target="_blank">help page</a>.</p>

<p>
This new interaction graph can be accessed from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu or through the
&quot;Gene Interactions&quot; track for the human assemblies
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=interactions" target="_blank">hg38</a> or
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=interactions" target="_blank">hg19</a>.
Note that while this tool can be accessed from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu while browsing any
genome assembly, the data will always be based on human sources.</p>

<p>
A huge thank you to the many
<a href="help/hgGeneGraph.html#credits" target="_blank">collaborators and contributors</a>
who helped by providing their databases and expertise, notably Hoifung Poon and Chris Quirk at 
Microsoft Research who provided text mining data. Thank you to Max Haeussler and Matthew Speir at 
the UCSC Genome Browser for all of their efforts in the creation and release of these new resources.

<h2>Jun. 13, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New barChart track format</h2>
<p>
Are you loving the 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&hideTracks=1&gtexGene=pack&position=chr9%3A133255602-133275214">
GTEx track</a> and want to make a similar barChart display track for yourself? Are you wondering
how you can get boxplots of data points to show up on track item 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgc?db=hg38&c=chr9&l=133255601&r=133275214&o=133257408&t=133275201&g=gtexGene&i=ABO">
details pages</a>? Well, look no
further as we have just released support for a GTEx style 
<a href="help/barChart.html">barChart track format</a>. This new track format is
available for use with custom tracks, and in binary format (bigBarChart) for use in track hubs. 
Both barChart and bigBarChart formats support external matrix and sample files specifying data 
points for a boxplot display on details pages, while the barChart/bigBarChart file typically 
specifies summary values (mean or median) over the matrix, which determines the bar heights. See 
the <a href="help/barChart.html">documentation</a> for further explanation and examples. 
</p>

<p>
Along with the release of this new track format are some tools that help to create the tracks,
<code>expMatrixToBarchartBed</code> and <code>bedJoinTabOffset</code>. Both utilities are free for
all use cases, and can be downloaded from our <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe">
directory of utilities</a>. For more information about this new track format and helper scripts, 
please see the <a href="help/barChart.html">help documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Kate Rosenbloom, Christopher Eisenhart and Christopher Lee for the development
and testing of this new track format.

<h2>Jun. 8, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New command line tool for annotating variants, vai.pl</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new command-line tool for annotating variants, 
<code>vai.pl</code>. This program is similar to our web-based 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgVai">Variant Annotation Integrator (VAI)</a>, except it allows for bypassing 
the variant limit imposed by web-based VAI, and does not require connections to UCSC, allowing 
annotation of private clinical data.</p>

<p>
Along with the release of this program, we have published a 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/blog/annotating-millions-of-private-variants-with-vai-pl/">
new blog post</a> with some background on both web-based and command-line VAI, as well 
as some example usage to serve users. <code>vai.pl</code> is available for download from the
<a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu">genome-browser store</a>, via purchase of the GBiB, GBiC,
or full source.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Angie Hinrichs and Christopher Lee for the development and testing of the program.</p>

<h2>May 15, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New TransMap annotation tracks released</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of a new set of TransMap V4 tracks for nearly 70
different assemblies.</p>

<p> The TransMap tracks are an attempt to map features, such as mRNAs, ESTs,and gene predictions
from one organism to another through pairwise, whole-genome alignments. These new TransMap tracks
are:
<ul>
  <li>Ensembl Mappings</li>
  <li>RefSeq Gene Mappings</li>
  <li>GenBank RNA Mappings</li>
  <li>EST Mappings</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about how these tracks were created on the
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=transMapV4">track description page</a> for the
hg38/GRCh38 version of these tracks.</p>

<h2>May 4, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New BLAT custom track feature</h2>
<p>We are excited to announce the release of a long awaited feature: the ability to save  BLAT 
search results as a Genome Browser custom track.</p>

<p>Now, after running a BLAT search, you can save your results as a 
<a href="help/bigPsl.html">bigPsl</a> custom track with the click of a button. You can even 
configure the name and description of the track to your liking!</p>

<p>These custom tracks display and function exactly the same as BLAT results (with a slight 
coloring difference for amino acid searches), with the advantage that they will persist 
when saved in a session, just like any other custom track. That means you can now send your 
colleagues a session of your BLAT searches and they will still be able to see them weeks later!</p>

<p>Thanks to Brian Raney and Christopher Lee for the implementation and release of this feature.</p>

<h2>Mar. 3, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New NCBI RefSeq tracks released</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new set of gene annotation tracks
for the hg38/GRCh38 assembly based on data from NCBI's Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq).
For all of these tracks, the alignments and coordinates are provided by RefSeq.
These tracks are organized in a composite track that includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RefSeq All &ndash; all annotations from the curated and predicted sets
  <li>RefSeq Curated &ndash; curated annotations beginning with NM, NR, or YP
  <li>RefSeq Predicted &ndash; predicted annotations beginning with XM or XR
  <li>RefSeq Other &ndash; all other RefSeq annotations not included in RefSeq All
  <li>RefSeq Alignments &ndash; alignments of transcripts to the genome provided by RefSeq
</ul>
<p>
The new composite track also includes a &quot;UCSC RefSeq&quot; track that is based on our original
&quot;RefSeq Genes&quot; track. As with before, this UCSC track is a result of our realignments
of RefSeq RNAs to the genome, which means that there may be some cases where the annotations
differ from those in the new NCBI RefSeq tracks.</p>
<p>
More details about these tracks, their construction, and how to access their underlying data
can be found in

<h2>Jan. 23, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Genome Browser product gives freedom to easily collaborate in the
cloud</h2>
<p>
Until now, genomics research groups working with sensitive medical data were largely limited to 
using local Genome Browser installations to maintain confidentiality, complicating data-sharing 
among collaborators. Today, the Genome Browser group of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute 
announced they have changed that by launching a new product, Genome Browser in the Cloud (GBiC). 
GBiC introduces new freedom to collaborate by allowing rapid Browser installation, in any 
UNIX-based cloud.</p>
<p>
Users provide the cloud instance, then install the Genome Browser image and grant access to 
whomever needs it. GBiC functions the same and is as secure as the public version of the Genome 
Browser, Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB), or a Genome Browser mirror site. Another GBiC innovation 
is significantly reduced installation time as compared to earlier Genome Browser versions.</p>
<p>
&quot;We are very pleased with how this product facilitates remote collaboration &mdash; for 
example, between a hospital physician, an off-site lab technician and a third-party genomic 
researcher,&quot; said Genome Browser author and Principal Investigator Jim Kent. 
&quot;Thanks to the efforts of GBiC Engineer Max Haeussler, users also benefit from significantly 
faster installation time,&quot; Kent continued. &quot;What historically took at least a week, now 
typically is less than an hour,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>
While the GBiC is intended specifically for cloud-based installations, its functionality is 
versatile. For most purposes, the GBiC essentially replaces the manual installation process for 
mirroring the UCSC Genome Browser in multiple environments (cloud servers, dedicated servers, or 
even a laptop).</p>
<p>
GBiC is free for non-profit academic research and for personal use. Corporate use requires a 
license, a one-time setup fee of $2,000 and annual payment of $1,000 per instance. GBiC is 
available exclusively at the UCSC Genome Browser 
<a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">store</a>.</p>
<p>
For an installation demonstration, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcJERBVnjio"

<h2>Dec. 13, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Tissue Body Map track settings page for GTEx tracks</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new graphic-based 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGtexTrackSettings?&amp;g=gtexGene" 
target="_blank">&quot;Tissue Body Map&quot; configuration page</a> for the GTEx Gene 
Expression track. This new page allows users to view GTEx-sampled tissues in an 
anatomical context and select tissues from the anatomy graphic as an alternative to 
using the alphabetical tissue list.<br /><br />This new track settings page contains 
its original functionality, but uses a new interface for track configuration. Next to 
a color-coded checkbox list of the 53 tissues is an interactive illustration of a 
human anatomical "body map." Hovering over a tissue in the list will highlight the 
corresponding anatomical region in the body map image. To show or hide tissues in the 
GTEx Gene Expression track, tissue selections can be made by either selecting tissues 
in the list or by clicking on the tissue labels in the body map.</p>
<p>
To quickly see which tissues are selected, right-click the bar graph displayed in 
the browser for the GTEx track and then click the wrench icon to go to the 
&quot;Configure GTEx&quot; page. To navigate to the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGtexTrackSettings?&g=gtexGene" target="_blank">new track settings page</a> 
from the <a href="../" target="_blank">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, go to the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg38" target="_blank">hg38</a> 
or <a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg19" target="_blank">hg19</a> 
browser and click on the track label "GTEx" in the Expression group.<br /><br />In the 
coming months, we plan to incorporate the Tissue Body Map into other GTEx resources.</p>

<h2>Dec. 7, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp;New video: Substitute alternate haplotypes into hg38 chromosome</h2>
<p>
The Genome Reference Consortium has released many alternate haplotypes as part of the most recent 
human genome assembly, hg38 (GRCh38). Our new <a href="http://bit.ly/ucscAlts" 
target="_blank">video tutorial</a>, shows how to use the Genome Browser's multi-region viewing mode 
to substitute these sequences, along with their annotations, into the main chromosomes of
this assembly, as well as other genome assemblies with alternate haplotypes. The video was produced 
by Robert Kuhn and David Gibson.</p>

<h2>Nov. 7, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New CRISPR track for many assemblies</h2>
<p>
A new CRISPR/Cas9 track has been released for the human (hg38, hg19), mouse (mm10), rat (rn5), 
zebrafish (danRer7), C. elegans (ce10), D. melanogaster (dm6), yeast (sacCer3) and C. intestinalis 
(ci2) assemblies.</p>
<p>
This track shows regions of the genome within 200bp of transcribed regions and DNA sequences 
targetable by CRISPR RNA guides using the Cas9 enzyme from S. pyogenes (PAM: NGG). CRISPR target 
sites were annotated with predicted specificity (off-target effects) and predicted efficiency 
(on-target cleavage) by various algorithms using the tool 
<a href="http://crispor.org">crispor.org</a>.</p>
<p>
The details page for each target contains a wealth of information related to the target, 
such as the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2647" target="_blank">MIT Specificity score</a>, 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n10/full/nmeth.3543.html"
target="_blank">Moreno-Mateos Efficiency Score</a>, 
<a href="http://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design"

<h2>Nov. 3, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New chromosome aliases search support</h2>
<p> 
Have you ever wanted to use 1 instead of chr1 to search for a chromosome position?</p>
<p>
The hg38 assembly now supports a new feature of matching different chromosome aliases. Equivalent 
entries only exist in the new table, chromAlias, when an exact sequence match has been verified. 
This feature is limited to searching coordinates, it is not yet supported for custom tracks.</p>
<p>
For example, aliases that now map to chr1 are NC_000001.11, CM000663.2, and 1, so that a hg38 search
such as CM000663.2 16,560,000 16,615,000 will be equivalent to chr1 16,560,000 16,615,000.</p>

<h2>Aug. 30, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; Allele-specific expression in 53 tissues from GTEx Analysis Hub now
available</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of Allele Specific Expression (ASE) data for the human hg19 
and hg38 assemblies. ASE data from the <a href="http://tllab.org" target="_blank">Lappalainen 
Lab</a> at the New York Genome Center is now available in the UCSC Genome Browser as a public track 
hub.  This track hub contains ASE data identified from transcriptome and genotype
data in 53 tissues collected by the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index" 
target="blank">Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project</a> and analyzed by the Lappalainen Lab. 
The hub contains 3 tracks, a cross tissue summary via density graph of median allelic imbalance, 
a summary track of all SNPs with evidence of ASE in any tissue, and a composite track showing ASE 
on a tissue by tissue basis. In the composite track each subtrack is colored based on median ASE for
the site across all samples of the tissue, shaded on a spectrum of gray (low) to GTEx convention
tissue color (high).</p>
<p>
To access and view this hub, navigate to the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect"

<h2>Aug. 16, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 147 available for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from NCBI 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/"> dbSNP</a> Build 147 data, available on the two most 
recent human assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38. NCBI's dbSNP database is a collection of 
&quot;simple nucleotide polymorphisms&quot; (SNPs), which are a class of genetic variations
that include single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions (indels). This immense 
database contains over 150 million such SNPs that cover the human genome.</p>
<p>
There are four SNP tracks available as part of this release. One is a track containing all mappings 
of reference SNPs to the human assembly, labeled &quot;All SNPs (147)&quot;. The other three tracks 
are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Common SNPs (147): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or are 
100% non-reference.</li>
<li>
Flagged SNPs (147): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by dbSNP
as &quot;clinically associated&quot;.</li>
<li>
Mult. SNPs (147): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location. This track has 
been shrinking over the course of the last few releases as dbSNP now excludes most SNPs whose 
flanking sequences map to multiple locations in the genome.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (147) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls. You will find the other SNPs (147) tracks on both of GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 
browsers in the &quot;Variation&quot; group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Christopher Lee. We'd like to thank the dbSNP
group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>

<p>
We are excited to announce the support of <a href="help/cram.html" target="_blank">CRAM</a> files 
on the Browser!</p>
<p>
CRAM files, which are more dense than BAM files, use an additional external &quot;reference 
sequence&quot; file to both compress and decompress the read information. For CRAM tracks to load 
there is an expectation that the checksum of the reference sequence used to create the CRAM file 
will be in the CRAM header and be accessible from the 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/software/cram-reference-registry" target="_blank">EBI CRAM

target="_blank">Click here</a> to load an example CRAM file from the 1000 Genomes Project where 
reads are displayed as a bar graph using the &quot;Display data as a density graph&quot; option. 
Loading CRAM tracks is identical to loading BAM files, the only difference is that instead of 
providing the URL to a BAM file, the URL instead points to a CRAM file. Both use <code>type
bam</code> in hub and custom track lines, and both expect an associated index file (CRAM.crai for 
CRAMs).</p>

<h2>Jun. 28, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New way to share sessions - public sessions</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the release of the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgPublicSessions">Public 
Sessions</a> page, the newest way to share your UCSC Genome Browser snapshots with your colleagues
and the world. The Public Sessions page collects sessions that users have elected to share publicly.
Sessions on this page can be filtered based on assembly, name, or a phrase from the description. 
Sessions can also be sorted based on their popularity or creation date. To add your own sessions to 
this Public Sessions page, just check the box under "post in public listing" on the session 
management page.</p>
<p>
The Genome Browser <a href="../cgi-bin/hgSession">session management</a> page has also received an
update with the release of the new Public Sessions page. Sessions are now arranged in a table,
where varying numbers of sessions can be displayed on a page of this table. Sessions can now be
filtered and ordered based on session name, primary assembly, and creation date. Clicking on the
session name now displays that session in the Genome Browser. Session details, such as the name
or the description, can be changed using the "details" button in the new table layout.</p>
<p>
The release of the new Public Sessions page also marks a change in our session expiration policy.
We no longer expire sessions and associated custom tracks four months after their last use.
Please note, however, that the UCSC Genome Browser is not a data storage service and that we
encourage you to keep local copies of your session contents and custom track data.</p>
<p>
For more information about using sessions to share snapshots of the UCSC Genome Browser,
please see the <a href="help/hgSessionHelp.html">User Guide</a> or our blog post,

users in Asia. The genome-asia server <a href="http://genome-asia.ucsc.edu" 
target="_blank">(http://genome-asia.ucsc.edu)</a>, which is administered by UCSC, is physically 
located at the <a href="http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/" target="_blank">RIKEN Yokohama 
Campus</a> in Japan.</p>
<p>
Genome-asia is intended as an alternate, faster access point for those Browser users
who are geographically closer to Asia than to the western United States. The mirror
is functionally identical to the U.S.-based server, with one exception. Custom tracks
residing on the U.S. server are not automatically accessible from the genome-asia mirror;
therefore, the use of these custom tracks and saved sessions containing them will require
some manual intervention.</p>
<p>
Genome Browser users located in Asia will be automatically redirected to genome-asia
when they click the "Genomes" menu item on the Genome Browser home page, but will have
the option to remain on the U.S.-based server. In addition to the
genome-asia mirror, we continue to support a Europe-based Genome Browser mirror
<a href="http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">(http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu)</a>
in Bielefeld, Germany. A third-party mirror in <a href="http://genome-mirror.moma.ki.au.dk/" 
target="_blank">Aarhus, Denmark</a>, is available as an emergency backup in the rare event
that our three supported sites are offline.</p>
<p>
We wish to express our special thanks to Dr. Hideya Kawaji at the
<a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/accc/" target="_blank">RIKEN Advanced Center for 
Computing and Communication</a> for making this possible. We would also like to acknowledge the 
following members of the UCSC Genome Browser team for their efforts: Galt Barber, Robert Kuhn, 
Jorge Garcia, and Luvina Guruvadoo.</p>

<h2>Jun. 6, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New video: Exon-only mode</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release to our YouTube channel of a new
training <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNEJBOkf_Gk" target = _BLANK>video</a>,
in which we demonstrate the recently released Multi-Region feature in exon-only mode. This feature
is useful for those studying gene expression or undertaking whole-exome sequencing. By removing 
intronic and intergenic regions, exon-only mode shows the portion (sometimes as little as a few 
percent) of the genome most useful for these analyses.</p>
<p>
This video is <a href ="../training/vids/#vid09" TAGET = _BLANK>indexed</a> to allow easy access 
to relevant sections and comes with a transcript for the hard-of-hearing.</p>
<p>
Thanks to Robert Kuhn and David Gibson for production.</p>

<h2>Jun. 1, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New density graph feature</h2>
<p>
The Genome Browser is proud to announce a new &quot;density graph&quot; feature for
a variety of tracks, including BAM custom tracks, that converts data into a summary display.</p>
<p>
The density graph feature enables certain track types to be displayed as a bar graph where
the height is proportional to the number of reads mapped to each genomic position. Through dynamic 
calculation of items in the current window, this feature plots a line similar to a wiggle graph that
can be customized with a number of <a href="help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html"
target="_blank">graph-based configuration options</a> such as drawing indicator lines,
smoothing plots, adjusting graph height and vertical range, and switching from bars to
points. Please note that the feature is best displayed with Display mode set to full
and that the default is auto-scale data to view. Please note that using this
feature on a <a href="help/gbib.html#GbibMirroring"
target="_blank">virtual machine Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB)</a> may benefit from increasing 
memory.</p>
<p>
To turn on the feature click into the track controls for certain track types, such as a BAM custom 
track, and check the box next to &quot;Display data as a density graph&quot; to see graph 
configurations and then click &quot;Submit&quot;.  To see the new density graph feature in use, 
please see this example

<h2>May 10, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Gateway page</h2>
<p>
The UCSC Genome Browser team is proud to announce a newly redesigned 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway" target="_blank">Genome Browser Gateway</a> page.
The Gateway retains its original functionality as a central access point for all genome assemblies
available on our site, while sporting several helpful new features and updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Autocomplete searching for any genome browser, genome version, or public hub</li>
  <li>
  Species browsing through a scrollable visual
  &quot;tree&quot; menu based on phylogenetic order</li>
  <li>
  Quick access shortcuts to popular browsers</li>
  <li>
  New style and color scheme</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please see our <a href="https://youtu.be/5zc9sqd4SD4"
target="_blank">Gateway video</a> for an introduction to these new features.</p>
<p>
The new Gateway addresses the need for streamlined access to the rapidly 
growing number of genome assemblies available on our public site. 
As an alternative to scrolling through long drop-down menus of genome assemblies, you can
now simply type in assembly search terms for autocomplete recognition, visually scroll
through our collection, or click a button to access our most popular species.</p>
<p>
Note that a few browser utilities that were previously accessed through links and buttons on the 
Gateway page have been moved to the top menu bar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Browser reset: Genome Browser > Reset All User Settings</li>
  <li>
  Track search: Genome Browser > Track Search</li>
  <li>
  Add custom tracks: My Data > Custom Tracks</li>
  <li>
  Track hubs: My Data > Track Hubs</li>
  <li>
  Configure tracks and display: Genome Browser > Configure</li>
</ul>
<p>
We would like to acknowledge the following people for their contributions
to the new Gateway: original art by Jeff West Design, concept by Robert Kuhn,
software design by Angie Hinrichs, and quality assurance by Cath Tyner.</p>

<h2>Apr. 22, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; Data from the Lens PatSeq Database now available</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a set of tracks showing the genomic mapping of
biomedical sequences submitted as part of patent application documents worldwide. The sequence 
data, mappings and associated patent information were obtained from the 
<a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/bio" target="_blank">PatSeq</a> database provided by 
<a href="https://www.lens.org/" target="_blank">The Lens</a>. The PatSeq data are 
mapped to the genome, and the individual sequence features within the tracks are then
color-coded to indicate their status within the associated patent documents. 
Track details pages show information about the patent documents in which the sequences
are referenced, and provide a link to The Lens PatSeq Analyzer tool for the given chromosome 
range. The PatSeq data are divided into two tracks: a bulk patent track for sequences affiliated 
with patents in which more than 100 sequences were submitted, and a non-bulk patent track
for all other sequences. These tracks are currently present on the human (hg19), mouse (mm10),
and Ebola virus (eboVir3) genomes.</p>
<p>
Thanks to our collaborators at The Lens, Osmat Jefferson and Deniz Koellhofer, for providing the
data and feedback on the visualization. Thank you to Max Haeussler and Matthew Speir, members of
the UCSC Genome Browser team, for their efforts in creating these tracks.</p>

<a name="042016"></a>
<h2>Apr. 20, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New GTEx gene expression track for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the release of a new gene expression track based on data from the NIH
<a href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index" target = _BLANK> Genotype-Tissue Expression</a> 
(GTEx) project. This track displays tissue-specific gene expression based on RNA-seq in 53 tissues 
from 570 donors obtained from the GTEx 'midpoint' data release (V6, October 2015). The original data
for this track can be found at the <a href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home" 
target="_blank">GTEX Portal</a> hosted by the Broad Institute.</p>
<p>
This track also features a new gene expression display method that extends the traditional Genome 
Browser display &mdash; a horizontal bar graph. Every gene is annotated by a graph with colored 
bars, each of which corresponds to a specific tissue assayed by the GTEx project. Within
a graph, the bar color indicates the tissue type, using GTEx conventions, and the bar height 
depicts the median expression level (in RPKM).To quickly view the tissue and expression level 
represented by a bar in the tracks display, mouse over the bar in the graph. The complete tissue 
color legend is shown on the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=gtexGene" target="_blank">track
configuration page</a>, and can also be popped up for viewing alongside the track using the 
right-click menu. Below the bar graph, a line is shown indicating the gene extent that was used to 
generate the annotation, colored by gene class using GENCODE conventions (e.g. <span style='color: 
#0c0c78'>blue</span> for protein-coding, <span style='color: #006400'>green</span> for
non-coding).</p>
<p>
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doLoadUrl=submit&hgS_loadUrlName=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/sessions/gtexAnnouncementSession.txt" 
target="_blank"><img src="../images/gtexAnnounceExample.png" alt="GTEx announcement
session" width="822" height="254"></a></p>
<p>
User alert: In the figure above, do you notice how the bar graph sometimes extends past the 
righthand end of the associated gene annotation? This is because all bar graphs in the
display are the same width (and have the same tissue ordering) to facilitate comparison.
For example, in this figure (which may also be viewed 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doLoadUrl=submit&hgS_loadUrlName=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/sessions/gtexAnnouncementSession.txt" 
target="_blank">here</a>), the three tall bars in the annotation of the TCAP gene indicate this 
<em>entire</em> gene is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. It does <em>not</em> 
indicate that there are expression peaks in the intergenic region beyond the gene!</p>
<p>
Similar to other Genome Browser track displays, clicking on the graph will bring up a description 
page that shows a detailed box-and-whiskers plot of the RPKM data, as well as a description of the 
methods used to generate the data.</p>
<p>
Credit goes to Kate Rosenbloom and Christopher Lee for the implementation and testing of this 
feature.</p>

<h2>Apr. 15, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 146 available for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from NCBI 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/"> dbSNP</a> Build 146 data, available on the two most
recent human assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38. NCBI's dbSNP database is a collection of 
&quot;simple nucleotide polymorphisms&quot; (SNPs), which are a class of genetic variations
that include single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions (indels). This immense 
database contains over 150 million such SNPs that cover the human genome.</p>
<p>
There are four SNP tracks available as part of this release. One is a track containing all mappings 
of reference SNPs to the human assembly, labeled &quot;All SNPs (146)&quot;. The other three tracks 
are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Common SNPs (146): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or are 
  100% non-reference.</li>
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (146): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (146): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location. This track has
  been shrinking over the course of the last few releases as dbSNP now excludes most SNPs whose 
  flanking sequences map to multiple locations in the genome.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (146) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls.  You will find the other SNPs (146) tracks on both of GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 
browsers in the &quot;Variation&quot; group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Matthew Speir. We'd like to thank the dbSNP
group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>

<h2>Apr. 4, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; New video shows how to obtain sequence or coordinates for exons. </h2>
<p>
We have released a new <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/training/vids/index.html#vid08" 
target="_blank">video</a> to our YouTube channel. This newest installment in our effort to share the
capabilities of the Genome Browser shows how to use the Table Browser to obtain either the 
sequences or the coordinates for exons in the genes from a chosen region of the genome.</p>
<p>
We also want to take this opportuinty to remind you that we offer onsite 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/training/index.html" target="_blank">workshops</a> to help you and 
your colleagues make the most out of the Genome Browser.</p>

<h2>Apr. 1, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; Going back to our roots</h2>
<p>
For many years, the UCSC Genome Browser has provided a dynamic, cutting-edge interface for
viewing genomic data.  As time has gone by, however, it has become clear to us that we
cannot keep this up.  It is not fair to you, our users, that our interface keeps changing,
and it has increasingly been a burden on us to keep up with emerging web technologies.  Today
that all changes, as we return you to the roots of the web: ASCII.</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/joke04012016.png" alt="April Fools joke" width="712" height="279"></p>
<p>
We apologize again for subjecting you to so many changes over the years, and hope that this
new, more consistent interface will find your approval.</p>
<p>
In related news, we have also revised the interface for uploading custom tracks. Rather than
forcing you to wrestle with inconvenient file formats for your data or attempt to set up a web 
server, we now provide the option of loading your data from a deck of ISO 6586:1980 punch cards.  
Simply punch your data onto a deck and mail the deck to us. Our staff of highly trained 
specialists will take care of loading track, and will inform you by mail when the process is 
complete. Please note that our current policy of expiring unused custom tracks remains in effect; 
you must visit your track within 72 hours of the postmark date. Regrettably, decks cannot be 
returned.</p>
<p>Card decks may be addressed to:<br>
UCSC Genome Informatics Group<br>
Center for Biomolecular Science & Engineering<br>
CBSE, 501D Engineering II Building<br>
University of California, Santa Cruz<br>
1156 High Street<br>
Santa Cruz, CA 95064</p>
<p>
This new file format is also an option for data output from the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">UCSC
Table Browser</a>. Simply select &quot;mail card deck&quot; from the &quot;output format&quot; 
menu, and then enter your name and address on the subsequent page. Please allow 4-6 weeks for 
delivery.</p>

<h2>Mar. 8, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; Combine multiple regions of the Genome Browser into a single 
visualization</h2>
<p>
Have you ever wished you could remove all of the intronic or intergenic regions from the
Genome Browser display? Have you ever dreamed of being able to visualize multiple
far-flung regions of a genome? Well, now you can with the new &quot;multi-region&quot; option
in the Genome Browser!</p>
<p>
The multi-region modes provide four different ways to manipulate the display.
First, we have an &quot;exon-only&quot; mode that allows you to
remove all of the intergenic and intronic sequences from the display, leaving you with
only the exonic regions. Next, there is the &quot;gene-only&quot; mode allowing you to remove only
the intergenic regions from the display, leaving the genes with exons and introns intact.
Then there is the &quot;custom regions&quot; mode that allows you to use a remote BED file to
specify the regions you are interested in viewing alongside each other. Lastly, for human
assemblies hg17 and newer, there is the &quot;alternative haplotype&quot; mode that allows you to
view a haplotype sequence inserted into its position in the reference genome.</p>
<p>
To access these exciting, new multi-region modes, first select your organism and assembly
of interest and navigate to the Genome Browser visualization. Below the tracks display,
there is a button labeled &quot;multi-region&quot;. Clicking this button will bring up
a configuration box for the different multi-region modes. For example:</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/MultiRegionButton.png" alt="MultiRegion button" width="799" height="201"></p>
<p>
From this pop-up, you will be able to switch between the different modes or exit these multi-region 
modes if desired. For instance: </p>
<p>
<img src="../images/MultiRegionConfigurationWindow.png" alt="MultiRegion configuation 
window" width="757" height="312"></p>
<p>
Additionally, you can enter the &quot;Exon-only&quot; mode by typing the keyboard shortcut
&quot;e&quot; then &quot;v&quot;. You can exit any of the multi-region modes and return to the
default Genome Browser display by typing the keyboard shortcut &quot;d&quot; then &quot;v&quot;.</p>
<p>
For more information about each individual multi-region mode, please see the
<a href="help/multiRegionHelp.html">User Guide</a>.</p>
<p>
Thank you to Galt Barber, Matthew Speir, and the entire UCSC Genome Browser quality assurance team 
for all of their efforts in creating these exciting new display modes.</p>

  <li>
  Common SNPs (142): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population</li>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (142): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (142) are visible. The other tracks can be made visible using the 
track controls. These three SNPs (142) tracks can be found on the Mouse Dec. 2011 (mm10/GRCm38) 
browser in the Variation and Repeats group.</p>
<p>
Thank you to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> group at NCBI 
for making these data publicly available. The tracks were produced at UCSC by Brian Raney, Angie 
Hinrichs and Matthew Speir.</p>

<h2>Jan. 8, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 144 available for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from NCBI 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target ="_blank">dbSNP</a> Build 144 data, available on 
the two most recent human assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38.</p>
<p>
There are four SNP tracks available as part of this release. One is a track containing all mappings 
of reference SNPs to the human assembly, labeled &quot;All SNPs (144)&quot; The other three tracks 
are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Common SNPs (144): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or 
  are 100% non-reference</li>
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (144): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;li>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (144): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li> 
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (144) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls. You will find the other SNPs (144) tracks on both of GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 
browsers in the Variation group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Luvina Guruvadoo. We'd like to thank the 
dbSNP group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>

<h2>Dec. 16, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Output from related tables now available in the Data
Integrator</h2>
<p>
In the UCSC Genome Browser database, detailed information on the annotations for many tracks
is stored in extra tables. This information can include things such as identifiers
in other databases, transcript status, or other descriptive information. You can now obtain
data from these related tables in your output from the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.</p>
<p>
To add related tables to your Data Integrator output, first, select and add at least one
track to your data sources. Then, scroll down to the "Output Options" section and click the
<button type="button">Choose fields</button> button.
Lastly, at the bottom of the section for each selected track, you will see a drop-down menu
labeled "Related tables" which allows you to select and add various tables to your output.

<h2>Dec. 9, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Data from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 now available</h2>
<p>
We have made data from Phase 3 of the <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/" target="_blank">1000 
Genomes Project</a> available for the hg19 version of the human assembly. The data includes almost 
90 million variants in the form of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (InDels),
and structural variants (SVs). Each variant includes a detail page that incorporates links to the 
variant in the dbSNP database, quality scores, and allele frequency information for various 
populations. More information is available on the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=tgpPhase3">track description page</a>.</p>
<p>
In addition to variant calls, the data includes two tracks that highlight regions of the
genome that are accessible to next generation sequencing technologies that utilize paired-end reads.
One track contains regions that meet the  1000 Genomes Project &quot;pilot&quot; criteria while the 
other contains regions that meet a more &quot;strict&quot; set of guidelines. More information about
how these accessible regions were identified can be found on the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=tgpPhase3Accessibility">track description page</a>.</p>
<p>
Thank you to the 1000 Genomes Project and Tom Blackwell and Mary Kate Wing at the
University of Michigan for making these data available. Thank you to Angie Hinrichs

<h2>Nov. 25, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; New &quot;View - In External Tools&quot; menu sends data to 
prediction websites</h2>
<p>
Do you often get the current sequence with &quot;View - DNA&quot; just to copy and paste it into 
another website? With the new menu &quot;View - In External Tools&quot; you can now send the current
region to remote tools with two clicks.</p>
<p>
For example, when browsing hg38 and zoomed in on the start of a gene like ABO at
<a href="/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&position=chr9%3A133255000-133255555"
target="_blank">chr9:133,255,000-133,255,555</a>, click the View menu and select &quot;In External 
Tools&quot;, or simply type the keyboard shortcut &quot;s&quot; then &quot;t&quot;, to send the 
region to a list of different prediction tools.</p>
<p>
Some of the available tools (not available for all assemblies or all zoom levels)
are primer design and restriction enzyme predictions (Primer3Plus, Primer-BLAST,
NEBCutter), mRNA and protein predictions (RegRNA 2, Riboswitches, RNAfold, PFAM),
cis-regulatory predictions (Promoter 2, RSAT Metazoa), and CRISPR/Cas9 predictions
(CRISPOR, CHOPCHOP), as well as links to view the region at NCBI or Ensembl.
You can suggest other tools via our <a href="/cgi-bin/hgUserSuggestion">Suggestion Box</a>.</p>

<h2>Nov. 3, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; New quick links for the Browser's top menu bar</h2>
<p>
The &quot;Genomes&quot; menu now features direct links to jump to browsing the human (hg38 and hg19)
and mouse (mm10 and mm9) assemblies! These links also preserve location information, such 
as a favorite gene's location, allowing users to quickly compare available annotation 
tracks between two assemblies.</p>
<p>
The &quot;Genome Browser&quot; menu now features a "Configure" link to quickly set visibilities for 
all tracks on the currently browsed assembly and a "Reset All User Settings" option that will 
remove all external hubs and custom tracks data while resetting the entire browser to default 
visibilities and the hg38 assembly.</p>

<a name="092315"></a>
<h2>Sep. 23, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; New keyboard shortcuts on the Genome Browser</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the addition of keyboard shortcuts to navigate the Genome Browser 
display. It's now possible to zoom in and out, navigate left and right, hide all tracks, configure 
the browser display and much more using only your keyboard. Use the "?" key to view the entire list 
of shortcuts. Happy browsing!</p>

<h2>Sep. 14, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Human Genome Browser default changed to GRCh38/hg38</h2>
<p>
In conjunction with the release of the new 100-species Conservation track on the
hg38/GRCh38 human assembly, we have now changed the default human browser on our
website from hg19 to hg38. This should not affect your current browsing sessions;
if you were last looking at the hg19 (or older) browser, the Genome Browser will
continue to display that assembly for you when you start it up. There are circumstances,
however, in which the selected assembly can switch to the newer version. For instance,
the assembly will switch to hg38 if you reset your browser defaults. If you find
yourself in a situation where some of your favorite browser tracks have &quot;disappeared&quot;,
you may want to check that you're viewing the right assembly.</p>
<p>
We will continue our efforts to expand the annotation track set on the hg38 browser
to include many of the tracks present on previous human assemblies. In cases where
it makes sense, data may be simply &quot;lifted&quot; from hg19 using migration tools.
In many instances, however, we must rely on our data providers to generate new versions
of their data on the latest assembly. We will publish these data sets as they become available.</p>
<p>
For a summary of the new features in the GRCh38 assembly, see the 
<a href="newsarch.html#030614">overview</a> we published in March 2014.</p>

<h2>Sep. 10, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; 100 Species Conservation Track now available on GRCh38/hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new Conservation track based on the human
(GRCh38/hg38) assembly. This track shows multiple alignments of 100 vertebrate species and
measurements of evolutionary conservation using two methods (phastCons and phyloP) from the
PHAST package for all species. The multiple alignments were generated using multiz and other
tools in the UCSC/Penn State Bioinformatics comparative genomics alignment pipeline. Conserved 
elements identified by phastCons are also displayed in this track. For more details, visit the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=cons100way">track description page</a>.</p>

We would like to thank Hiram Clawson and Jonathan Casper for their efforts in creating this 
track.</p>

<h2>Aug. 12, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; How to share your UCSC screenthoughts</h2>
<p>
Do you want to save your UCSC Browser screenthoughts, or share them with a colleague,
or make a slide for a talk, or publish them in a paper?  Saving the state of your screen
can take two forms: static or dynamic. You can snap and save a picture of the screen,
or you can share a link to an active Genome Browser. We talk about both approaches
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/blog/how-to-share-your-ucsc-screenthoughts/" 
target="_blank">here</a> and discuss some of the advantages and pitfalls of each.</p>

<h2>Jun. 29, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; GENCODE Genes now the default gene set on the Human (GRCh38/hg38) 
assembly</h2>
<p>
In a move towards standardizing on a common gene set within the bioinformatics community, UCSC has 
made the decision to adopt the GENCODE set of gene models as our default gene set on the human 
genome assembly. Today we have released the GENCODE v22 comprehensive gene set as our default gene 
set on human genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38), replacing the previous default UCSC Genes set generated 
by UCSC. To facilitate this transition, the new gene set employs the same familiar UCSC Genes 
schema, using nearly all the same table names and fields that have appeared in earlier versions of 
the UCSC set.  </p>
<p>
By default, the browser displays only the transcripts tagged as &quot;basic&quot; by the GENCODE 
Consortium. These may be found in the track labeled "GENCODE Basic" in the Genes and Gene 
Predictions track group. However, all the transcripts in the GENCODE comprehensive set are present 
in the tables, and may be viewed by adjusting the track configuration settings for the All GENCODE 
super-track. The most recent version of the UCSC-generated genes can still be accessed in the track 
&quot;Old UCSC Genes&quot;.</p>
<p>
The new release has 195,178 total transcripts, compared with 104,178 in the previous version. The 
total number of canonical genes has increased from 48,424 to 49,534. Comparing the new gene set with
the previous version: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  9,459 transcripts did not change.</li>
  <li>
  22,088 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
  <li>
  43,681 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, meaning that the two 
  transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the 
  lengths of their UTRs.</li>
  <li>
  28,950 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent splicing 
  (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a Genome Browser for the May 2012 assembly of bonobo, 
<em>Pan paniscus</em> (Max-Planck Institute panpan1, UCSC version panPan1). The assembly was 
provided by the <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max-Planck Institute for

<h2>Jun. 12, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Data Integrator</h2>
<p>
Have you ever wished that the Table Browser could associate your custom track items with some other 
track, while retaining the item names from both? We have released a new tool that can do just that, 
and more: the Data Integrator.</p>
<p>
Using the Data Integrator you can select up to five tracks, including custom tracks
and hub tracks, and output tab-separated text that contains all the fields from both
the first track and the overlapping items from the other track(s). If you need only
a subset of the fields from your selected tracks, the Data Integrator allows you to
choose which fields to include in the output. You can also query your current Genome
Browser position, search for positions of items such as genes, SNPs, etc. by name,
query over a set of up to 1000 positions, and even retrieve genome-wide data
(subject to data size). The Data Integrator output can be viewed in your web browser
window or downloaded to an optionally gzip-compressed file. Look for &quot;Data Integrator&quot;
in the Genome Browser Tools menu (top blue bar) if you'd like to try it out. </p>
<p>
For more information about the Data Integrator's capabilities and usage, see the
user's guide: <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgIntegratorHelp.html">

<h2>Apr. 8, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; bigGenePred format now supported in the Genome Browser</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce that the UCSC Genome Browser now supports data in bigGenePred format. 
bigGenePred format stores annotation items that are a linked collection of exons, much as BED files 
do, but bigGenePred has additional information about the coding frames and other gene specific 
information. bigGenePred files are created initially from BED-type files with some extra fields, 
using the program bedToBigBed with a special AutoSql file that defines the fields of the 
bigGenePred. The resulting bigBed files are in xed binary format. The advantage of these bigBed 
files is that only portions of the files needed to display a particular region are transferred to 
UCSC. So for large data sets, bigBed is considerably faster than regular BED files.</p>
<p>
This new format is available for use in custom tracks and data hubs. For more information about 
bigGenePred, please see our 
<a href="help/bigGenePred.html">bigGenePred Track Format help page</a>.</p>

<h2>Apr. 1, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; New GRCz10 zebrafish assembly now available</h2>
<p>
The most recent zebrafish assembly -- GRCz10 (UCSC version danRer10, Sep. 2014) -- is now
available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This is the first zebrafish release by the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/zebrafish/"
target="_blank">Genome Reference Consortium</a>, who took over the improvement and
maintenance of the zebrafish genome assembly.</p>
<p>
The GRCz10 assembly improves upon Zv9 by utilizing optical mapping and additional meiotic
mapping to fill gaps with new clone sequence and improve the positioning of assembly
components.  This has also been supplemented with a new whole genome shotgun assembly
WGS31. The result is an assembly with a sequence length of 1.3 Gb in 26 chromosomes and
1,035 scaffolds.  For more details about the GRCz10 assembly, see the

of files from our download servers: <strong>UDR (UDT Enabled Rsync)</strong>. UDR utilizes rsync
as the transport mechanism, but sends the data over the UDT protocol, which enables huge amounts of 
data to be downloaded efficiently over long distances.</p>
<p>
We now have two identical download servers to better serve your needs. You can use either one:
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu</a></li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://hgdownload-sd.sdsc.edu" target="_blank">http://hgdownload-sd.sdsc.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The background</strong></p>
<p>
Typical TCP-based protocols like http, ftp and rsync have a problem in that the further
away the download source is from you, the slower the speed becomes. Protocols like UDT/UDR
allow for many UDP packets to be sent in batch, thus allowing for much higher transmit speeds
over long distances. UDR will be especially useful for users who are downloading from
locations distant to California. <em>The US East Coast and the international community will
likely see much higher download speeds by using UDR rather than rsync, http or ftp.</em></p>
<p>
<strong>Getting UDR & setting it up on your system</strong></p>
<p>
It should be noted that UDR is not written or managed by UCSC, it was written by the
Laboratory for Advanced Computing at the University of Chicago. It has been tested to work
under Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OSX, but may work under other UNIX variants. The source code can
be obtained here, through GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR" 
target="_blank">https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR</a></p>
<p>
If you need help building the UDR binaries or have questions about how UDR functions,
please read the documentation on the GitHub page, and if necessary, contact the UDR authors
via the GitHub page. We recommend reading the documentation on the UDR GitHub page to better
understand how UDR works. UDR is written in C++. UDR is Open Source and is released under the
Apache 2.0 License. You must first have rsync installed on your system.</p> 
<p>
For your convenience, we are offering a binary distribution of UDR for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x 
and 7.x (or variants such as CentOS 6/7 or Scientific Linux 6/7). You'll find the rpm packages 
here: <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/udr" 
target="_blank">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/udr</a>.</p>
<p>
For RHEL 6 we have 32-bit and 64-bit packages, but for RHEL 7 we have dropped the 32-bit and offer 
onlya 64-bit package. Those who need a 32-bit package for RHEL 7 can download the source and compile
it locally.</p>
<p>
<strong>Example of using UDR to download ENCODE data from the UCSC Genome Browser Download
Server</strong></p>
<p>
Once you have a working UDR binary, either by building from source or by installing the rpm
(if you are using RHEL 6.x or other variant), you can download files from either of our 
download servers in a fashion very similar to rsync. For example, using rsync, you may want
to download all of the ENCODE information for the mm9 database using the command:</p>
<pre><code>$ rsync -avP rsync://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/encodeDCC/ /my/local/mm9/</code></pre>
<p>
Using UDR is very similar. The UDR syntax for downloading the same data would be:</p>
<pre><code>$ udr rsync -avP hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::goldenPath/mm9/encodeDCC/ /my/local/mm9/</code></pre>
<p>
If you installed the rpm, use the 'man udr' command for more information via the man page;
if you installed from source please refer to the UDR GitHub page for more details on the
capabilities of UDR and how to use it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Firewall Considerations</strong></p>
<p>
UDR establishes connections on TCP/9000, then transmits the data stream over UDP/9000-9100.
Your institution may need to modify its firewall rules to allow inbound and outbound ports
TCP/9000 and UDP/9000-9100 from either of the two download machines.</p>
<p>
If you decide to install and use UDR, we hope that you experience greatly increased download
speeds. If you have difficulties installing UDR on your system, please contact the Laboratory
for Advanced Computing through their github page: <a href="https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR"
target="_blank">https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR</a>.</p>

<h2>Feb. 12, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Blat your assembly hub</h2>
<p>
Assembly data hubs, track hubs that allow researchers to annotate genomes that are not in the UCSC 
Genome Browser, can now use blat to quickly find DNA and protein sequences in their unique 
assemblies.</p>
<p>
While running remote blat servers with the gfServer utility, you can now add lines to your assembly 
hub's genomes.txt file to inform the Browser where to send blat searches. Or by downloading and 
installing a virtual machine Genome Browser In a Box <a href="help/gbib.html" 
target="_blank">(GBiB)</a>, you can alternatively locally run gfServers, preinstalled on GBiB, all 
from your laptop. For more information see the 
<a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Assembly_Hubs" target="_blank">Assembly Hub Wiki</a>

<h2>Feb. 11, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 142 available for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from NCBI 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> Build 142 data, available on 
the two most recent human assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38. The new tracks contain a 
substantial amount of additional annotation data not included in previous dbSNP tracks, with 
corresponding coloring and filtering options in the Genome Browser.</p>
<p>
There are four SNP tracks available as part of this release. One is a track containing all mappings 
of reference SNPs to the human assembly, labeled &quot;All SNPs (142)&quot; The other three tracks 
are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Common SNPs (142): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or are 
  100% non-reference</li>
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (142): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;</li>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (142): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (142) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls. You will find the other SNPs (142) tracks on both of GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 
browsers in the Variation group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Jonathan Casper. We'd like to thank the 
dbSNP group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>
<p>
As part of this release, we are also retiring the older dbSNP Build 135 and 137 data from display 
on the GRCh37/hg19 human assembly. Those tracks will still be available for viewing on our
<a href="http://genome-preview.soe.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">preview server</a>, and the associated 
masked FASTA files will continue to be available on our <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu"

<h2>Oct. 9, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB)</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you just want to keep your genomics data to yourself. Have you ever hesitated when 
uploading your data set into the UCSC Genome Browser? If so, you'll be happy to know that we have 
created a stand-alone personal version: Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB). If you have sensitive 
genomics data that you would like to view securely on your own laptop in the context of the UCSC
Genome Browser, GBiB is for you.</p>
<p>
GBiB is an easy-to-install personal copy of the Genome Browser that comes preloaded with the most 
popular annotation tracks for human. It is highly configurable &mdash; you can access or download 
other annotation tracks of interest, or view any of the other 90+ organisms featured in the public
Genome Browser. GBiB runs inside of Oracle's free VirtualBox virtual machine. It has the same core 
functionality as the UCSC Genome Browser, but keeps your data private and local to your own 
computer.</p>
<p>
GBiB is free for non-profit academic research and for personal use. Commercial use requires 
purchase of a license with setup fee and annual payment. Download or purchase GBiB in our secure 
online <a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu/">store</a>.</p>
<p>
You can read more about GBiB on our 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/blog/genome-browser-in-a-box-gbib-origins/">blog</a> or in

<h2>Oct. 20, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 141 available for hg19 and hg38</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from NCBI
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> Build 141 data, available on 
the two most recent human assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38. The new tracks contain additional 
annotation data not included in previous dbSNP tracks, with corresponding coloring and filtering 
options in the Genome Browser.</p>
<p>
There are three SNP tracks available for the GRCh37/hg19 assembly. One is a track containing all 
mappings of reference SNPs to the human assembly, labeled &quot;All SNPs (141)&quot;. The other two 
tracks are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Common SNPs (141): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or are 
  100% non-reference</li>
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (141): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike previous dbSNP releases for GRCh37/hg19, Build 141 does not include mappings to alternate 
haplotype sequences. In addition, variants that map to multiple genomic locations (e.g. to different
chromosomes, or more than one position on the same chromosome) have been removed.</p>
<p>
This release also marks the first set of dbSNP data available for the newest human assembly, 
GRCh38/hg38. In addition to the three tracks described for hg19, there is one additional track 
available for hg38:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (141): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (141) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls. You will find the other SNPs (141) tracks on both of GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38 
browsers in the Variation group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Matthew Speir. We'd like to thank the dbSNP 
group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>

<h2>Jun. 19, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; Conservation track released for rat</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of a new Conservation track based on the rat 
(RGSC 5.0/rn5) assembly. This track shows multiple alignments of 13 vertebrate species and 
measurements of evolutionary conservation using two methods (phastCons and phyloP) from the 
PHAST package for all species. The multiple alignments were generated using multiz and other
tools in the UCSC/Penn State Bioinformatics comparative genomics alignment pipeline. Conserved 
elements identified by phastCons are also displayed in this track. For more details, visit the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=rn5&g=cons13way"> track description page</a>.</p>
<p>
With the release of this new conservation track, we have changed the default rat browser on 
site from rn4 to rn5. In general, the Genome Browser will continue to display
whichever rat assembly you have already been viewing, and will default to the rn5 assembly 
only for those users who haven't recently viewed a rat assembly. However, there are 
circumstances in which the assembly may update the view to the newer version, for instance 
if you reset your browser settings to the default values. If you find yourself
in a situation where some of your favorite browser tracks have &quot;disappeared&quot;, you 
may want to check that you're viewing the expected assembly.</p>
<p>
We would like to thank Pauline Fujita, Matthew Speir, and Hiram Clawson for their efforts in
creating this track.</p>

<h2>Apr. 29, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; 100-species Conservation track re-release</h2>
<p>
We released the initial version of the 100-species Conservation track for the hg19 human assembly 
in Nov.2013. Over the past few months, we found a couple of inconsistencies and decided, for the 
integrity of the data, that we should rerun the computation pipeline and re-release the data. The 
fixes required minimal changes, and resulted in a more precise data set. We published the new 
version of the hg19 100-species Conservation track on 15 April 2014.</p>
<p>
Here are more details about the two fixes that we made:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  We tracked down the cause of some unusual gaps in the alignments to a bug in the multiz program 
  used in our alignment pipeline. The Penn State Bioinformatics Group provided us with a fixed 
  version of multiz that we used to rerun the pipeline. </li>
  <li>
  We inadvertently used the pre-release assembly for one of the species in the 100-way alignment: 
  the panda. We replaced this assembly with the correct version and verified that the data sets for 
  all other species were correct before rerunning the pipeline.</li>

<h2>Mar. 6, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; The new GRCh38 Human Genome Browser is here</h2>
<p>
In the final days of 2013, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/" 
target="_blank">Genome Reference Consortium</a> (GRC) released the eagerly awaited GRCh38 
human genome assembly, the first major revision of the human genome in more than four years. During 
the past two months, the UCSC team has been hard at work building a browser that will let our users 
explore the new assembly using their favorite Genome Browser features and tools. Today we're 
announcing the release of a preliminary browser on the GRCh38 assembly. Although we still have 
plenty of work ahead of us in constructing the rich feature set that our users have come to expect, 
this early release will allow you to take a peek at what's new.</p> 
<p>
Starting with this release, the UCSC Genome Browser version numbers for human assemblies will match 
those of the GRC to minimize version confusion. Hence, the GRCh38 assembly is referred to as hg38 in
Genome Browser datasets and documentation. We've also made some slight changes to our chromosome 
naming scheme that affect primarily the names of haplotype chromosomes, unplaced contigs and 
unlocalized contigs. For more details about this, see the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg38">hg38 gateway page</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>What's new in GRCh38?</strong></p> 
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Alternate sequences</strong> - Several human chromosomal regions exhibit sufficient 
  variability to prevent adequate representation by a single sequence. To address this, the 
  GRCh38 assembly provides alternate sequence for selected variant regions through the 
  inclusion of  <em>alternate loci scaffolds</em> (or <em>alt loci</em>). Alt loci are 
  separate accessioned sequences that are aligned to reference chromosomes. This assembly 
  contains 261 alt loci, many of which are associated with the LRC/KIR area of chr19 and the 
  MHC region on chr6. (See the 
  <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?chromInfoPage=">sequences</a> page for a complete list of 
  the reference chromosomes and alternate sequences in GRCh38.)</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Centromere representation</strong> - Debuting in this release, the large megabase-sized 
  gaps that were previously used to represent centromeric regions in human assemblies have been 
  replaced by sequences from centromere models created by 
  <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/4/697.abstract" target="_blank">Karen Miga et al.</a> 
  of UCSC's <a href="http://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/people/kent" target="_blank">Kent lab</a>, under the 
  guidance and mentorship of the <a href="http://www.genome.duke.edu/labs/WillardLab/"
  target="_blank">Willard lab</a> at Duke University. The models, which provide the approximate 
  repeat number and order for each centromere, will be useful for read mapping and variation 
  studies. </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Mitochondrial genome</strong> - The mitochondrial reference sequence included in the 
  GRCh38 assembly and hg38 Genome Browser (termed &quot;chrM&quot; in the browser) is the 
  <a href="http://mitomap.org/bin/view.pl/MITOMAP/HumanMitoSeq" 
  target="_blank">Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence</a> (rCRS) from 
  <a href="http://mitomap.org/MITOMAP" target="_blank">MITOMAP</a> with GenBank accession 
  number J01415.2 and RefSeq accession number NC_012920.1. This differs from the chrM 
  sequence (RefSeq accession number NC_001907) used by the previous hg19 Genome Browser, 
  which was not updated when the GRCh37 assembly later transitioned to the new version.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Sequence updates</strong> - Several erroneous bases and misassembled regions in GRCh37 
  have been corrected in the GRCh38 assembly, and more than 100 gaps have been filled or reduced. 
  Much of the data used to improve the reference sequence was obtained from other genome 
  sequencing and analysis projects, such as the <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/" 
  target="_blank">1000 Genomes Project</a>.</li>  
  <li>
  <strong>Analysis set</strong> - The GRCh38 assembly offers an &quot;analysis set&quot; that was 
  created to accommodate next generation sequencing read alignment pipelines. Several
  GRCh38 regions have been eliminated from this set to improve read mapping. 
  The analysis set may be downloaded from the Genome Browser 
  <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/analysisSet/"
  target="_blank">downloads page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh38/README"

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/883148/#/st_Primary-Assembly"
target="_blank">statistics about this assembly</a>. Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation

<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#human">Downloads</a> page. The annotation 
tracks for this browser were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>
<strong>Much more to come!</strong> This initial release of the hg38 Genome Browser provides a 
rudimentary set of annotations.  Many of our annotations rely on data sets from external 
contributors (such as our popular SNPs tracks) or require massive computational effort 
(our comparative genomics tracks). In the upcoming months/years, we will release many more 
annotation tracks as they become available. To stay abreast of new datasets, join our 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/group/genome-announce?hl=en"

<p>
We'd like to thank our GRC and NCBI collaborators who worked closely with
us in producing the hg38 browser. Their quick responses and helpful feedback were a
key factor in expediting this release. The production of the hg38 Genome Browser was
a team effort, but in particular we'd like to acknowledge the engineering efforts of Hiram 
Clawson and Brian Raney, the QA work done by Steve Heitner, project guidance
provided by Ann Zweig, Robert Kuhn, and Jim Kent, and documentation work by Donna
Karolchik. See the <a href="credits.html#human_credits">Credits</a> page for a detailed

<h2>Jan. 22, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; All the DNA on the internet now at your fingertips</h2>
<p>
We're pleased to announce the release of the Web Sequences track on the UCSC Genome Browser.
This track, produced in collaboration with Microsoft Research, contains the results of a 30-day 
scan for DNA sequences from over 40 billion different webpages. The sequences were then mapped with 
Blat to the human genome (hg19) and numerous other species including mouse (mm9), rat (rn4), and 
zebrafish (danRer7). The data were extracted from a variety of sources including patents, online 
textbooks, help forums, and any other webpages that contain DNA sequence. In essence, this track 
displays the Blat alignments of nearly every DNA sequence on the internet! The
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=pubsBingBlat">Web Sequences</a>
track description page contains more details on how the track was generated.</p>
<p>
We would like to acknowledge Max Haeussler and Matt Speir from the UCSC Genome Browser staff
and Bob Davidson from Microsoft Research for their hard work in creating this track.</p>

<h2>Jan. 14, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; Two E. coli comparative assembly hubs now available</h2>
<p>
We're pleased to add two new assembly hubs produced by the UCSC
<a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/team/" target="_blank">David Haussler lab</a> to our
collection of publicly available hubs. The new hubs feature over 60 bacterial assemblies,
including more than 55 different E. coli strains. The assembly annotations include genes, 
pathogenic genes, conservation, GC percent, repetitive elements and much more.</p>
<p>
These hubs focus on comparative genomics and showcase the new &quot;snake&quot; track type. Snakes, 
which visualize alignments from
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format20">Hierarchical Alignment</a>
(HAL) files, provide a way to view sets of pairwise gapless alignments that may overlap on 
both the chosen genome (reference) and the query genome, and show various types of genomic 
variations such as insertions, substitutions, and duplications. More details about the new snake 
track display and its configuration options can be found on our Genome Browser
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" 
target="_blank">help</a> page.</p>
<p>
To access and view these hubs, navigate to the
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect">Track Hub gateway page</a>
and select one of the two E. coli comparative assembly hubs from the Public Hubs list.</p>
<p>
We would like to acknowledge Ngan Nguyen, Glenn Hickey, Brian Raney, Joel Armstrong, 
Benedict Paten, Matt Speir, and Luvina Guruvadoo for their hard work in creating these hubs.</p>

<h2>Oct. 23, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 138 available for hg19</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from NCBI
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> Build 138 data, available on 
the human assembly (GRCh37/hg19). The new tracks contain additional annotation data not included in 
previous dbSNP tracks, with corresponding coloring and filtering options in the Genome Browser.</p>
<p>
As was the case for the annotations based on the previous dbSNP build 137, there are four tracks in 
this release. One is a track containing all mappings of reference SNPs to the human assembly, 
labeled &quot;All SNPs (138)&quot;. The other three tracks are subsets of this track and show 
interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Common SNPs (138): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population or are 
  100% non-reference</li>
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (138): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;li>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (138): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (138) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls.</p>
<p>
You will find the four SNPs (138) tracks on the Human Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) browser in the 
Variation and Repeats group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Luvina Guruvadoo. We'd like to thank the 
dbSNP group at NCBI for providing access to these data.</p>

<h2>Aug. 22, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; Three new human variation tracks released</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of three tracks that describe human genetic variation. They 
are based on the <a href="http://lovd.nl/2.0/index_list.php" target="_blank">Leiden Open Variation 
Database (LOVD)</a>, the <a href="http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php" target="_blank">Human Gene
Mutation Database Public (HGMD)</a>, and amino acid mutations in the 
<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt database</a>. The majority of the data 
were collected from publications by curators in the three databases.</p>
<p>
The three databases have varying license restrictions. UniProt provides complete information about 
the mutation amino acid change, the disease and a link to the publications that mention it. LOVD 
provides the mutation and a link to a website with disease and publication details. HGMD provides 
some coordinates and a link to its own website which requires registration.</p>
<p>
These tracks are intended for use primarily by physicians and other professionals concerned with 
genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and by advanced students in science and medicine. While 
the Genome Browser database is open to the public, users seeking information about a personal 
medical or genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for diagnosis and for 
answers to personal questions.</p>
<p>
We'd like to thank all three databases for their help in putting the data together. The tracks were 
produced at UCSC by Maximilian Haeussler and Steve Heitner.</p>

<h2>Jul. 22, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; Variant Annotation Integrator</h2>
<p>
In order to assist researchers in annotating and prioritizing thousands of variant calls from 
sequencing projects, we have developed the Variant Annotation Integrator (VAI). Given a set of 
variants uploaded as a custom track (in either <a href="../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format10">pgSnp</a>
or <a href="help/vcf.html">VCF</a> format), the VAI will return the predicted functional effect 
(e.g., synonymous, missense, frameshift, intronic) for each variant. The VAI can optionally add
several other types of relevant information, including: the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> identifier if the variant is 
found in dbSNP, protein damage scores for missense variants from the 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP" target="_blank">Database of Non-synonymous 
Functional Predictions (dbNSFP)</a>, and conservation scores computed from multi-species alignments.
The VAI also offers filters to help narrow down results to the most interesting variants.</p>
<p>
Future releases of the VAI will include more input/upload options, output formats, and annotation 
options, and a way to add information from any track in the Genome Browser, including custom 
tracks.</p>
<p>
There are two ways to navigate to the VAI:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  From the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, follow the &quot;Variant Annotation Integrator&quot; link.</li> 
  <li>
  After uploading a custom track, press the &quot;go to variant annotation integrator&quot; button. 
  The user's guide is at the bottom of the page, under &quot;Using the Variant Annotation 
  Integrator.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thank you to Angie Hinrichs, Bob Kuhn, Brian Raney, Brooke Rhead, and Jonathan Casper for their 
input and work on this feature.</p>

<h2>Jul. 2, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; Assembly Data Hubs</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce a new feature in the UCSC Genome Browser: Assembly Data Hubs.</p>
<p>
Assembly Data Hubs extend the functionality of Track Data Hubs to assemblies that are not hosted 
natively on the Browser. Assembly Data Hubs were developed to address the increasing need for 
researchers to annotate sequence for which UCSC does not provide an annotation database. They allow 
researchers to include the underlying reference sequence, as well as data tracks that annotate that 
sequence. Sequence is stored in the UCSC twoBit format, and the annotation tracks are stored in the 
same manner as Track Data Hubs.</p>
<p>
To read more about using Assembly Data Hubs, or about creating your own, see these guides:</p>

<h2>Jul. 2, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; New gene alleles feature on the details pages of UCSC genes</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the release the new Gene Alleles feature on the details pages of UCSC 
genes. For each protein-coding gene in the UCSC Genes track, variant data from the 2,184 (per 
autosome) phased chromosomes from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project have been distilled into 
&quot;gene haplotype alleles&quot;. Each haplotype allele is a distinct set of variants found on at 
least one of the 1000 Genomes subject chromosomes. For each haplotype, we display its frequency in
the 1000 Genomes populations and indicate the frequency with which it occurs homozygously in each 
population. Unexpected frequencies of occurrence may thus be used to identify alleles that merit 
further study. Predicted protein sequence for common haplotypes can also be displayed, allowing 
differences among alleles to be used to identify differences at the amino acid level.</p>
<p>
To see the Gene Alleles feature, go to the details page for any protein-coding gene in the UCSC 
Genes track and click the &quot;Gene Alleles&quot; link in the &quot;Page Index&quot; matrix. This
will take you to the &quot;Common Gene Haplotype Alleles&quot; section. For more information on 
this feature see: <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/haplotypes.html">

<h2>Jun. 28, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;UCSC Genes track released for GRCh37/hg19</h2>
<p>
We're happy to announce the release of an updated UCSC Genes track for the GRCh37/hg19 human Genome 
Browser.  The new release has 82,960 total transcripts, compared with 80,922 in the previous 
version. The total number of canonical genes has increased from 31,227 to 31,848. Comparing the new 
gene set with the previous version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  74,657 transcripts did not change between versions.</li>
  <li>
  88 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
  <li>
  5,556 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, meaning that the two 
  transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the 
  lengths of their UTRs.</li>
  <li>
  621 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set but do not show consistent splicing, 
  i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>
More details about the new UCSC Genes track can be found on the 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=knownGene" >UCSC Genes track description

<h2>Jun. 27, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; New supported European mirror site established</h2>
<p>
The UCSC Genome Browser is pleased to announce the introduction of a new mirror site to serve our 
users in Europe. Genome-euro is an official European mirror site of the UCSC Genome Browser at 
<a href="http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu</a>. The server 
is physically located at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld Center for Biotechnology in Bielefeld, 
Germany, and is administered by UCSC. Genome-euro is meant to be an alternate, faster access point 
for those Browser users who are geographically closer to central Europe than to the western United 
States.</p>
<p>
All functionality will be the same as on the US server, although Custom Tracks will not be 
transfered. Saved Sessions containing Custom Tracks will require some manual 
<a href= "http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/genomeEuro.html#sessions" 
target="_blank">intervention</a>.</p>
<p>
When European users navigate to the US server home page and click the &quot;Genomes&quot; menu item,
they will receive a notification that they have been redirected to the more geographically 
appropriate server. They will have the option to remain on the US server, as described in our
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/genomeEuro.html" 
target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>
The backup mirror in <a href="http://genome-mirror.moma.ki.au.dk/" target="_blank">Aarhus, 
Denmark</a> will continue to serve as an emergency site in the event of the official sites in 
California and Germany malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
We wish to express our special thanks to our colleagues at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld 
Bioinformatics, especially Jens Stoye, for making this possible.</p>

By default, only the Common SNPs (137) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls.</p>
<p>
You will find the three SNPs (137) tracks on the Mouse Dec. 2011 (GRCm38/mm10) browser in the 
Variation and Repeats group.</p>
<p>
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Luvina Guruvadoo.</p>

<h2>Feb. 11, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; Denisova tracks released on hg19 browser</h2>
<p>
In conjunction with the publication of the paper by Meyer <em>et al.</em>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936568">A High-Coverage Genome Sequence from an 
Archaic Denisovan Individual</a> the UCSC Genome Browser is hosting a set of new tracks. Briefly, 
Meyer <em>et al.</em> applied a novel single-stranded DNA library preparation method to DNA 
previously extracted from 40mg of a phalanx bone excavated from Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains
in southern Siberia.</p>
<p>	
Two supporting datasets and one analysis dataset are now available in the Genome Browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Modern Human Variants: variant calls made from sequence reads of eleven individuals 
  mapped to the human genome, used in statistical analyses to put the divergence of the 
  Denisova genome into perspective with regard to present-day humans.</li>
  <li>
  Denisova Sequence: high-coverage (30X) sequence reads from an archaic Denisovan individual mapped 
  to the human genome reference assembly.</li>
  <li>
  Modern Human Derived, Denisova Ancestral: mutations in the modern human lineage that rose to 
  fixation or near fixation since the split from the last common ancestor with Denisovans, along 
  with predicted functional effects from Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP).</li>
</ul>
<p>
We'd like to thank Richard Green and the many authors of the Science paper for providing the UCSC 
Genome Browser with these data. We'd also like to acknowledge the hard work of the UCSC Genome 
Browser staff who pulled together the annotations and information for these tracks: Angie Hinrichs 
and Pauline Fujita.</p>

<h2>Dec. 7, 2012 &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 137 available for hg19</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from dbSNP build 137, available on 
the human assembly (GRCh37/hg19). dbSNP build 137 is available at NCBI. The new tracks contain 
additional annotation data not included in previous dbSNP tracks, with corresponding coloring and 
filtering options in the Genome Browser.</p>
<p>
As was the case for previous annotations based on dbSNP data, there are four tracks in this release.
One is a track containing all mappings of reference SNPs to the uman assembly, labeled &quot;All 
SNPs (137)&quot;. The other three tracks are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily 
defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Common SNPs (137): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population</li>
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (137): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;</li>
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (137): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, only the Common SNPs (137) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls.</p>
<p>
You will find the four SNPs (137) tracks on the Human Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) browser in the 
Variation and Repeats group. The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Steve 
Heitner.</p>

<h2>Nov. 27, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; New UCSC Genes track released for mouse</h2>
<p>
We're happy to announce the release of a new UCSC Genes track for the GRCm38/mm10 mouse Genome 
Browser.</p>
<p>
The new release has 59,121 transcripts, compared with 55,419 in the previous version on mm9. The 
total number of canonical genes has increased from 28,661 to 31,227. Comparing the new gene set 
with the previous version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  48,739 transcripts did not change between versions.</li>
  <li>
  423 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
  <li>
  5,108 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, meaning that the two 
  transcripts show consistent splicing.</li>
  <li>
  1,037 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set.</li>
</ul>
<p>
More details about the new UCSC Genes track can be found on the 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=knownGene">UCSC Genes track description 
page</a>. Also, please note that GRCm38/mm10 is now the default mouse assembly on the Genome 
Browser Gateway.</p>
<p>
Many thanks to Brian Raney, Jim Kent, and Luvina Guruvadoo for their work on this track.</p>

<h2>Nov. 14, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; ENCODE tutorials available from OpenHelix</h2>
<p>
OpenHelix and the UCSC Bioinformatics group have collaborated to provide free access to the newly 
updated ENCODE tutorial until the end of February 2013.</p>
<p>
The online tutorial suite, which runs on most Internet browsers, teaches users how to access the 
ENCODE data in the UCSC Genome Browser. The approximately 60-minute tutorial was created by 
OpenHelix in conjunction with the UCSC Bioinformatics Group, and can be viewed at no cost at 
<a href="http://www.openhelix.com/ENCODE2" target="_blank">http://www.openhelix.com/ENCODE2</a>. 
The material has been updated to reflect recent changes to the UCSC Genome Browser, and can be 
viewed sequentially or navigated using chapters and forward/backward sliders. The original, older 
tutorial is still available at <a href="http://www.openhelix.com/ENCODE" 
target="_blank">http://www.openhelix.com/ENCODE</a>.</p>
<p>
In addition to the tutorial, users can access other useful training materials including the 
animated PowerPoint slides used as a basis for the tutorial, a suggested script for the slides, 
slide handouts, and exercises.</p>

<h2>Sep. 17, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Retiring the Proteome Browser </h2>
<p>
We are announcing the imminent retirement of the Proteome Browser. The Proteome Browser was 
introduced in 2003 to provide access to protein-specific information independent of the genomic 
details presented in the Genome Browser. Since then we've incorporated much of this information 
into the UCSC Genes details page accessible from the Genome Browser, and into the columns of the 
Gene Sorter. Our decision to retire this tool was based on its low usage and our desire to focus 
our work on the more frequently used UCSC Genes track and the Gene Sorter. Access to the databases 
that supported the Proteome Browser (uniProt and proteome) will still be available through the Table
Browser and our public MySQL server.</p>

<h2>Aug. 16, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Announcing a Genome Browser for the medium ground finch</h2>
<p> 
We have released a browser for the Medium ground finch, <em>Geospiza fortis</em>, renowned as one of
naturalist Charles Darwin's Galapagos finches. This species, which has been the subject of many 
evolutionary studies, is one of a group of birds that evolved over a few million years from a single
ancestral species into multiple species whose beak sizes and shapes are specialized for using 
different food resources. The phenotypic diversity of these birds contributed to Darwin's theory of 
evolution. The significance of this genome assembly is described in the Aug. 16, 2012, 
<a href="https://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article/1939" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by 
the UCSC Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE).</p>
<p>
The initial Medium ground finch genome assembly (GeoFor_1.0, UCSC version geoFor1) is the product 
of a collaboration between the Genome 10K project and Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) to sequence 
100 vertebrate species, and is the first to be released in the UCSC Genome Browser. For more 
information about the <em>G. fortis</em> genome, see the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/13302" target="_blank">NCBI website</a>.</p>
<p>
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/geoFor1/">FTP server</a> or the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#mediumgroundfinch">Downloads</a> page. 
The browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. See the 
<a href="credits.html#mediumgroundfinch_credits">Credits</a> page for a detailed list of the 
organizations and individuals who contributed to this release. We'd like to thank BGI for 
contributing the data for this assembly and acknowledge the UCSC staff members who released this 
browser: Hiram Clawson and Greg Roe.</p>

<h2>Aug. 14,  2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to our website</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce a few changes to the look and feel of the Genome Browser website. In 
addition to a new font throughout the site, the first thing you might notice is a new menu bar 
across the top of many of the pages. We have reorganized the navigation on our web applications with
you in mind; we hope you find it more intuitive! </p>
<p> 
Additionally, we greatly simplified the search mechanism by collapsing all search methods into a 
single box.</p>

<h2>Jul. 16,  2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Tasmanian devil assembly now available in Genome Browser</h2>
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of a Genome Browser for the Feb. 2011 Tasmanian devil 
assembly, <em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em> (WTSI version Devil_refv7.0, UCSC version sarHar1). The 
Tasmanian devil, which is native to the island of Tasmania, is at risk of extinction due to a 
transmissible facial cancer. The devil population in Tasmania has declined by more than 80% since 
the first time the disease was observed 14 years ago. This draft assembly, created by the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, was 
sequenced using Illumina reads. This completed genome is the first step towards finding genetic 
mutations in the transmissible cancer, which will help researchers understand the disease and its 
spread.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sarHar1/">FTP server</a> or the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#tasmanian_devil">Downloads</a> page. The 
Tasmanian devil browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. See

<h2>Jul. 6, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Retirement of hgText CGI</h2> 
<p>	
We are announcing the imminent retirement of the hgText CGI.  hgText was the original version of the
Table Browser, and was replaced by the new CGI, hgTables, in <a href="#100104">2004</a>. A very 
small number of our users still access the database using the old hgText CGI. We plan to remove 
hgText from our site on Jul. 24, 2012, after which all users must use hgTables.</p>

<a name="061912"></a>
<h2>Jun. 19, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Many new assemblies available in the browser</h2>
<p> 
With the abundance of new vertebrate assemblies available in GenBank, the UCSC Genome Browser team 
has streamlined its browser release pipeline in the effort to keep pace. In the past week we have 
released a new browser on the Western painted turtle and updated assemblies for the cow, rat, and 
chicken. Browsers for the lesser hedgehog tenrec and the latest dog assembly should be available 
later this week, for a total of 18 assemblies released in the past half year. You can expect many 
new assemblies to show up on our website in upcoming months, along with broader multiple alignment 
annotations on selected organisms that include many of the new assemblies.</p> 
<p> 
Keep in mind that some of these new assemblies may not yet be fully populated with annotation 
tracks. Some data, such as the data underlying genes and SNPs tracks, may not be immediately 
available, and other annotations (e.g., comparative genomics tracks) may take a while to generate. 
As always, our mandated focus is on vertebrates, with a particular emphasis on richly annotating the
human genome, although we do provide occasional updated assemblies for other selected model 
organisms (fly, worm, yeast).</p> 
<p> 
We regret that we don't have the resources to support the many other genomics research communities 
who would like us to visualize their data in our browser, but we can provide you with information 
for setting up your own browser or track hub to display your data, as well as links to other 
visualization resources on the web that are specific to your genome of interest. Feel free to

<h2>Apr. 18, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; GRC planning phase for GRCh38 human reference assembly</h2> 
<p> 
The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/" target="_blank">Genome 
Reference Consortium</a> (GRC) plans to update the human reference assembly to GRCh38 in the summer 
of 2013. This revision is aimed at addressing issues found with the current model for representing 
genome assemblies, which uses a single, preferred tiling path to produce a single consensus 
representation of the genome. Subsequent analysis has shown that for most mammalian genomes a single
tiling path is insufficient to represent a genome in regions with complex allelic diversity. The 
GRC is working to create assemblies that better represent this diversity and provide more robust 
substrates for genome analysis.</p> 
<p>
If you have questions, concerns or feedback about the plans for the GRCh38 assembly, the GRC would 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/contact.shtml" 
target="_blank">like your input</a>.</p>

<a name="030712"></a>
<h2>Mar. 7, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; New mouse browser available</h2> 
<p> 
We have released the latest Genome Browser for the Dec. 2011 mouse genome assembly produced by the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/mouse/" target="_blank">Mouse 
Genome Reference Consortium</a> (Genome Reference Consortium GRCm38, UCSC version mm10). This 
version, which includes approximately 2.6 Gb of sequence, is considered to be &quot;essentially 
complete&quot;. The assembly includes chromosomes 1-19, X, Y, M (mitochondrial DNA) and chr*_random 
(unlocalized) and chrUn_* (unplaced clone contigs). Note that the UCSC mm10 database contains only 
the reference strain C57BL/6J.</p> 
<p>					
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser

<h2>Feb. 29, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; RGD Genes available for rn4</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of RGD Genes for rat (Baylor 3.4/rn4). This track shows 
protein-coding gene annotations curated by <a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/" target="_blank">RGD</a>. 
This track replaces UCSC Known Genes as the main gene track for this assembly.</p> 
<p> 
More details about this track can be found on the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=rn4&g=rgdGene2" 
target="_blank">RGD Genes track description page</a>.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank RGD for providing the base annotations for this track. The RGD Genes track was 
produced by Fan Hsu, Mary Goldman and Hiram Clawson.</p>

<a name="021012"></a>
<h2>Feb.10, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 135 available for hg19</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from dbSNP build 135, available on the
human assembly (GRCh37/hg19). dbSNP build 135 is available at NCBI. The new tracks contain 
additional annotation data not included in previous dbSNP tracks, with corresponding coloring and 
filtering options in the Genome Browser.</p> 
<p> 
As was the case with dbSNP build 132, there are four tracks in this release. One track, labeled 
&quot;All SNPs (135)&quot;, contains all mappings of reference SNPs to the human assembly. The other
three tracks are subsets of this track and show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>
  Common SNPs (135): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population</li> 
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (135): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;</li> 
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (135): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
By default, only the Common SNPs (135) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls.</p> 
<p> 
You will find the four SNPs (135) tracks on the Human Feb.  2009 (GRCh37/hg19) browser in the 
Variation and Repeats group.</p> 
<p> 
Many thanks to dbSNP at NCBI for the data, and to Mary-Claire King at the University of Washington 
for helpful comments that motivated us to enhance our dbSNP annotations. The tracks were produced at
UCSC by Angie Hinrichs and Brooke Rhead.</p>

<h2>Feb. 2, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; New UCSC Genes track released for GRCh37/hg19</h2>
<p> 
We're happy to announce the release of an updated UCSC Genes track for the GRCh37/hg19 human Genome 
Browser. This release includes more noncoding transcripts based on data from 
<a href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Rfam</a> and from the 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=tRNAs">tRNA Genes track</a> contributed 
by the <a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Todd Lowe lab</a> at UCSC.</p> 
<p> 
The new release has 80,922 total transcripts, compared with 77,614 in the previous version. The 
total number of canonical genes has increased from 27,297 to 31,227. Comparing the new gene set with
the previous version:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  24,804 transcripts did not change between versions.</li>
  <li>
  483 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li> 
  <li>
  46,367 transcripts are &quot;compatible&quot; with those in the previous set, meaning that the two
  transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the 
  lengths of their UTRs.</li> 
  <li>
  5,960 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set but do not show consistent splicing, 
  i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites.</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
Additionally, several improvements where made to the UCSC Genes build pipeline:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  We developed new genomic alignment protocols for aligning short sequences, facilitating the 
  expansion of the noncoding RNA content.</li> 
  <li>
  We changed the way that gene symbols are assigned to transcripts so that names from curated 
  sources are favored over names coming directly from GenBank mRNA records. This change resolved 
  several confusing naming issues reported to us by users.</li> 
  <li>
  We tracked down and corrected a bug in the pipeline that was causing a number of poor quality 
  protein mappings to displace high quality protein mappings.</li> 
  <li>
  We have started producing two new tables, knownGeneTxMrna and knownGeneTxPep, that contain 
  sequence derived from the genome rather than from the mRNA used for the transcript.</li>  
</ul> 
<p> 
More details about the new UCSC Genes track can be found on the 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=knownGene">UCSC Genes track description 
page</a>.</p>

Many thanks to Melissa Cline, Jim Kent, Brian Raney, Mark Diekhans, and Brooke Rhead for their work 
on this track.</p>

<h2>Jan. 3, 2012  &nbsp;&nbsp; Roadmap Epigenomics now available through data hub at Washington 
University</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of the Roadmap Epigenomics data on the UCSC Genome Browser 
through our data hub utility. The Roadmap Epigenomics Project is part of The NIH Common Fund's 
<a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/epigenomics/" target="_blank">Epigenomics Program</a>. 
It was launched with the goal of producing a public resource of human epigenomic data to catalyze 
basic biology and disease-oriented research. The Consortium leverages experimental pipelines built 
around next-generation sequencing technologies to map DNA methylation, histone modifications, 
chromatin accessibility and small RNA transcripts in stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues 
selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in 
human disease. The Consortium expects to deliver a collection of normal epigenomes that will provide
a framework or reference for comparison and integration within a broad array of future studies.</p> 
<p> 
All data were produced and processed by the <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/" 
target="_blank">Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium</a>, and will be periodically updated. 
Genome Browser tracks were constructed and hosted by <a href="http://vizhub.wustl.edu/" 
target="_blank">VizHub</a> at Washington University in St.  Louis. Tracks are available at UCSC 
Genome Browser via the data hub utility, or follow this 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hubUrl=http://vizhub.wustl.edu/VizHub/RoadmapRelease4.txt">link</a>.

<h2>Dec. 19, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; Variant Call Format (VCF) now supported in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce that the UCSC Genome Browser now supports Variant Call Format (VCF). 
VCF is a flexible and extendable line-oriented text format developed by the 1000 Genomes Project for
releases of single nucleotide variants, indels, copy number variants and structural variants 
discovered by the project. Similar to bigBed, bigWig and BAM, the Browser transfers only the 
portions of VCF files necessary to display viewed regions, making VCF a fast and attractive option 
for large data sets. VCF files will need to be compressed and indexed using the tabix package 
available from <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SAMtools</a>. This new 
format is available for use in custom tracks and data hubs. For more information about VCF and 
tabix, please see our <a href="help/vcf.html">VCF Track Format help page</a>.</p>

<h2>Nov. 7, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; UMD cow assembly now available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
In response to the many requests from the bovine research community, we now offer the University of 
Maryland (UMD) <em>Bos taurus</em> assembly in the Genome Browser, in addition to the assemblies 
produced by the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center. The UMD v3.1 assembly 
(Nov. 2009, UCSC bosTau6) was produced by the <a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/" 
target="_blank">UMD Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</a> (CBCB) in College Park, 
MD.</p> 
<p> 
The UMD 3.1 assembly is based on reads downloaded from the NCBI Trace Archive, most of which were 
sequenced by the Baylor College of Medicine. UMD reports that they were able to apply several 
assembly improvement techniques to produce an assembly that is substantially more accurate and 
complete than previous alternative versions, as evaluated using independent metrics. Based on UMD 
statistics, this assembly provides more genome coverage, closes thousands of gaps, corrects many 
erroneous inversions, deletions, and translocations, and fixes thousands of single-nucleotide 
errors. For more information, see Zimin, AV <em>et al.</em>,

<a name="090811"></a>
<h2>Sep. 8, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; New navigation and display features</h2> 
<p> 
We've added several new features to the Genome Browser that make it easier to quickly configure and 
navigate around in the browser's annotation tracks window.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Automatic image resizing:</strong> The first time the annotation track window is displayed, 
or after the Genome Browser has been reset, the size of the track window is now set by default to 
the width that best fits your Internet browser window. If you subsequently resize your browser 
window, you can automatically adjust the annotation track image size to the new width by clicking 
the <em>resize</em> button under the track image. The default width can still be manually overridden
on the Track Configuration page.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Scrolling left or right in the track window:</strong> You can now scroll (pan) horizontally 
through the tracks image by clicking on the image, dragging the cursor to the left or right, then 
releasing the mouse button. The view may be scrolled by up to one image width.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Improved drag-zoom navigation:</strong>  The browser's &quot;drag-and-zoom&quot; feature 
lets you quickly zoom to a specific region of interest on the annotation tracks image. To define the
region you wish to zoom to, click-and-hold the mouse button on one edge of the desired zoom area 
(which can be anywhere in the tracks window), depress the shift key, drag the mouse right or left 
to highlight the selection area, then release the mouse button. The annotation tracks image will 
automatically zoom to the new region. The Genome Browser still supports the earlier implementation 
of this feature, which restricted the click-drag to the Base Position track area of the image, but 
did not require the shift key to be pressed.</p> 
<p>  
<strong>Reordering groups of tracks:</strong> You can now vertically reposition an entire group of 
associated tracks in the tracks image (such as all the displayed subtracks in a composite track) by 
clicking and holding the gray bar to the left of the tracks, dragging the group to the new position,
then releasing the mouse button. To move a single track up or down, click and hold the mouse button 
on the side label, drag the highlighted track to the new position, then release the mouse
button.</p> 
<p>
If you haven't yet tried the browser's right-click menu for quick access to frequently used track 
configuration features and functionality, read more <a href="newsarch.html#011011">here</a>.</p>

<a name="081811"></a>
<h2>Aug. 18, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; New feature: Track Data Hubs</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to announce a new feature in the UCSC Genome Browser: track data hubs. Track hubs 
are web-accessible directories of genomic data that can be viewed on the UCSC Genome Browser 
alongside native annotation tracks. The Track Hub utility allows efficient access to data sets from 
around the world through the familiar Genome Browser interface. Browser users can display tracks 
from any public track hub that has been registered with UCSC. Additionally, users can import data 
from unlisted hubs or can set up, display, and share their own track hubs.</p> 
<p>
The data underlying the tracks in a hub reside on the remote server of the data provider rather than
at UCSC. The data are stored in compressed binary indexed files in bigBed, bigWig or BAM format that
contain the data at several resolutions. When a hub track is displayed in the Genome Browser, only 
the relevant data needed to support the view of the current genomic region are transmitted rather 
than the entire file. The transmitted data are cached on the UCSC server to expedite future access. 
This on-demand transfer mechanism eliminates the need to transmit large data sets across the 
Internet, thereby minimizing upload time into the browser.</p> 
<p>
To check out some track data hubs that are already available, most notably those from the NIH 
Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium, press the &quot;Track Hubs&quot; button in the genome 
Browser or follow this link:

tracks for both hg18 and hg19. With the kind assistance of Ada Hamosh (director), Joanna Amberger 
and Francois Schiettecatte of the OMIM project, we have divided the OMIM records into three separate
tracks:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs</strong> -- Variants in the OMIM database that have 
  associated dbSNP identifiers.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>OMIM Genes</strong> -- Genomic positions of gene entries in the OMIM database. The 
  coloring indicates the associated OMIM phenotype class.</li>
  <li> 
  <strong>OMIM Phenotypes - Gene Unknown</strong> -- Regions known to be associated with a 
  phenotype, but for which no specific gene is known to be causative. This track also includes 
  known multi-gene syndromes.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
The new tracks can be found in the Phenotype and Disease Associations track group below the browser 
graphic and are searchable by OMIM number. In most cases, simply typing the 6-digit MIM number into 
the position/search box on the Browser will take you to the record.</p>
<p> 
The OMIM data are the property of Johns Hopkins University and will not be available for download 
from UCSC. Please contact the OMIM project at <a href="http://omim.org/downloads" 
target="_blank">omim.org</a> for download information.</p> 
<p> 
UCSC thanks engineers Fan Hsu, Brooke Rhead and Robert Kuhn for this release.</p>

<h2>Apr. 18, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; dbSNP 132 available for hg19</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of four tracks derived from 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> build 132, available 
on the human assembly (GRCh37/hg19). dbSNP build 132 is available at NCBI. The new tracks contain 
additional annotation data not included in previous dbSNP tracks, with corresponding coloring and 
filtering options in the Genome Browser.</p> 
<p> 
As was the case for previous annotations based on dbSNP data, there is a track that contains all 
mappings of reference SNPs to the human assembly; it is now labeled &quot;All SNPs (132)&quot;. 
Three new tracks have been added to show interesting and easily defined subsets of dbSNP:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  Common SNPs (132): uniquely mapped variants that appear in at least 1% of the population</li> 
  <li>
  Flagged SNPs (132): uniquely mapped variants, excluding Common SNPs, that have been flagged by 
  dbSNP as &quot;clinically associated&quot;</li> 
  <li>
  Mult. SNPs (132): variants that have been mapped to more than one genomic location</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
By default, only the Common SNPs (132) are visible; other tracks must be made visible using the 
track controls.</p> 
<p> 
The counts of distinct reference SNPs and their mappings to hg19 differ greatly among the 
tracks:</p> 
<table> 
  <tr>
    <th>Track</th> 
    <th>Reference SNPs</th> 
    <th>Mappings to hg19</th></tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Common SNPs (132)</td> 
    <td>13,842,381</td> 
    <td>14,024,295 *</td></tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Flagged SNPs (132)</td> 
    <td>17,899</td> 
    <td>18,084 *</td></tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Mult. SNPs (132)</td> 
    <td>1,114,599</td> 
    <td>3,568,988</td></tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>All SNPs (132)</td> 
    <td>30,030,754</td> 
    <td>33,026,121</td></tr> 
</table> 
<p> 
*The Common and Flagged tracks have more mappings than SNPs due to the alternate haplotype sequences
and the pseudoautosomal regions on X and Y. SNPs are considered uniquely mapped if they map only 
once to a haploid reference genome. These regions add non-haploid sequence to the reference genome; 
therefore, multiple mappings involving these regions are still considered unique.</p> 
<p> 
You will find the four SNPs (132) tracks on the Human Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) browser in the 
Variation and Repeats group.</p> 
<p> 
Many thanks to dbSNP at NCBI for the data, and to 
<a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/king.htm" target="_blank">Mary-Claire King</a> at the 
University of Washington for helpful comments that motivated us to enhance our dbSNP annotations. 
The tracks were produced at UCSC by Angie Hinrichs, Brooke Rhead, Bob Kuhn, and Jim Kent.</p>

<h2>Apr. 18, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; Sheep browser released</h2> 
<p>
We are happy to announce a Genome Browser for the initial release of sheep (<em>Ovis aries</em>) 
genome. The Feb. 2010 <em>Ovis aries</em> draft assembly (NCBI project 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=genomeprj&cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10709" 
target="_blank">10709</a>, 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Ovis_aries/Ovis_aries_1.0/" 
target="_blank">GCA_000005525.1</a>) was produced by the <a href="http://www.sheephapmap.org/" 
target="_blank">International Sheep Genomics Consortium (ISGC) sequencing center</a>. The 
mitochondrial genome was sequenced by <a href="http://www.uni-giessen.de/cms/" 
target="_blank">Justus-Liebig-University</a>.</p> 
<p>
There are 27 chromosomes: chr1 - chr26, chrX, plus the mitochondrial sequence chrM from GenBank 
accession NC_001941, for a total sequence length of 2,860,512,983 bases. There are 1,659,241,706 
&quot;N&quot; bases in gaps, leaving 1,201,271,277 ACGT bases.</p> 
<p>The genome has been sequenced using 454 FLX sequencing to 3X coverage (DNA derived from six 
female sheep each sequenced with 0.5X coverage). Contigs were assembled based on alignment to the 
bovine genome and ordered into ovine chromosomes using BAC-end sequences and the virtual sheep 
genome.</p> 
<p>
We'd like to thank the International Sheep Genomics Consortium (ISGC) sequencing center and 
Justus-Liebig-University for providing this assembly. We'd also like to acknowledge the UCSC team 
who worked on this release: Chin Li, Greg Roe, and Luvina Guruvadoo. The sheep browser annotation 
tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p>

<h2>Mar. 4, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning of red: consensus on color scheme for CNVs</h2> 
<p> 
Consensus was reached on color standards to represent CNV loss (red) and gain (blue) in genomics 
databases by DGV, NCBI, DECIPHER, UCSC and ISCA during the 1st annual ISCA Scientific 
Conference.</p> 
<p> 
At the recent ISCA Scientific Conference in Atlanta, GA, Nigel Carter, representing DECIPHER, made 
a plea for a standardized color scheme for representation of CNV loss (deletion) or gain 
(duplication). Discussions in person and by email with leaders of major CNV/genomic databases 
(including DGV, dbVar, ISCA, and the UCSC Genome Browser) resulted in the recommendation to utilize 
red to represent loss/deletion (consistent with the original convention for CGH on metaphase 
chromosomes) and blue to represent gain/duplication (avoiding green which is difficult for 
color-blind individuals to discriminate from red).</p> 
<p>

is now conforming to this standard for the DECIPHER track and the DGV track on human assemblies 
(which was released today) and on any future tracks derived from dbVar.</p>

<h2>Mar. 1, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated chimpanzee browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We are happy to announce the release of a Genome Browser for the latest release of the chimpanzee 
(<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) genome. The Oct. 2010 assembly -- CGSC v2.1.3, UCSC version panTro3 -- 
was produced by the 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pan%20troglodytes&SECTION=collaborators" 
target=_BLANK>Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium</a>.</p> 
<p> 
This assembly covers about 97 percent of the genome and is based on 6X sequence coverage. It 
comprises 192,898 contigs with an N50 length of 44 kb and 33,990 supercontigs with an N50 length of 
8.4 Mb. Improvements introduced with the 2.1.3 assembly include the addition of over 300,000 
finishing reads and the merging in of 640 finished BACS. Approximately 49,000 additional merges were
made in this assembly as compared with the 2.1 assembly.</p> 
<p> 
The whole genome shotgun data were derived primarily from the donor Clint, a captive-born male 
chimpanzee from the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta, GA, USA. The sequence data were 
assembled and organized by the Washington University Genome Center. The underlying whole genome 
shotgun data were generated at the Washington University School of Medicine and the Broad Institute.

<h2>Jan. 19, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; Browser released for zebrafish Zv9 assembly</h2> 
<p> 
The most recent zebrafish assembly -- Zv9 (UCSC version danRer7, Jul. 2010) -- is now available in 
the UCSC Genome Browser. This assembly was produced by <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" 
target="_blank">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, UK.</p> 
<p>
The Zv9 assembly comprises a sequence length of 1.4 Gb in 26 chromosomes and 1,107 scaffolds. This 
assembly is based on a clone path sorted with the high-density meiotic map SATMAP (Clark et al., in 
preparation). The data freeze was taken on Apr. 1, 2010. The remaining gaps were filled with 
sequence from WGS31, a combined Illumina and capillary assembly. The assembly integration process 
involved sequence alignemnts as well as cDNA, marker and BAC/Fosmid end sequence placements. The 
zebrafish mitochondrial sequence is also available in the Genome Browser as the virtual chromosome, 
chrM. For more details about the Zv9 assembly, see the Sanger Institute page for the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv9_assembly_information.shtml"

<h2>Jan. 10, 2011  &nbsp;&nbsp; Introducing Genome Browser right-click navigation</h2> 
<p> 
Several of the common display and navigation operations offered on the Genome Browser tracks page 
may now be quickly accessed by right-clicking on a feature on the tracks image and selecting an 
option from the displayed menu. Depending on context, the right-click feature will let you change 
the track display mode, zoom in or out to the exact position coordinates of the feature, open the 
&quot;Get DNA&quot; window at the feature's coordinates, display details about the feature, open a 
popup window to configure the track's display, or display the entire tracks image in a separate 
window for inclusion in spreadsheets or other documents. (Note that the &quot;PDF/PS&quot; option in
the Genome Browser top navigation bar can also be used to generate a high-quality annotation tracks 
image suitable for printing.)</p>
<p> 
<img src="../images/rightclick.png" alt="Right-click screenshot" width="576" height="306"></p>
<p> 
To use the right-click feature, make sure the &quot;Enable advanced javascript features&quot; 
option on the 
<a hreF="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgTracksConfigPage=configure+tracks+and+display">tracks configuration 
page</a> is checked, and configure your internet browser to allow the display of popup windows from 
<em>genome.ucsc.edu</em>. When enabled, the right-click navigation feature replaces the default 
contextual menu typically displayed by your internet browser when you right-click on the tracks 
image. A few combinations of the Mozilla Firefox browser on Mac OS do not support the right-click 
menu functionality using secondary click; in these instances, you must use the explicit ctrl-click 
action to display the menu.</p> 
<p> 
Credit goes to Larry Meyer and Brooke Rhead for doing the lion's share of the design, development 
and testing of this feature, with engineering support from Tim Dreszer and additional testing by 
several others on the QA team.</p>

<h2>Dec. 2, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; Searching for tracks just got easier</h2> 
<p> 
The number of genome assemblies and annotation tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser has increased 
exponentially over the past few years. Along with this growth, it has become more difficult for 
browser users to sort through the many tracks to find the data they're interested in.</p> 
<p> 
With our latest Genome Browser release, we've introduced a new track search feature that will help 
you to quickly and easily find and display specific annotation data sets. The search feature is 
available via the &quot;track search&quot; button on the browser gateway and tracks display 
pages.</p> 
<p> 
The default search takes one or more terms as input, and returns a list of all the browser tracks in
which the name, description, group or associated metadata contains the terms. The advanced search 
option lets the user fine-tune the search based on the track name, description, and group. 
Individuals interested in the ENCODE data available on selected human genome assemblies can use the 
advanced search to specify particular ENCODE metadata terms, such as cell line, experiment type, 
etc.</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/tracksearch.gif" alt="Track search screenshot" width="648" height="305"></p>
<p> 
Once the list of search results is shown, you may choose which tracks you'd like to view in the 
browser, and can adjust the display modes. The search results list is sortable by multiple criteria,
and provides direct links to detailed track descriptions and additional information about the 
tracks.</p> 
<p> 
Special thanks to Tim Dreszer and Larry Meyer for implementing track search, and to the QA team for 
their work in testing and finetuning it. We hope our users, particularly those exploring ENCODE 
data, will take advantage of this new feature. As always, we appreciate your feedback. Please send

<h2>Aug. 24, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; New drag and reorder functionality released</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce new functionality in the Genome Browser. It is now possible to rearrange 
the order that tracks appear in the browser image directly from the browser image itself. To reorder
tracks, click-and-hold the side label or gray mini-button of a single track and drag the highlighted
track to a new position within the image.</p> 
<p> 
Because reordering is now available in the browser image itself, we have removed the &quot;enable 
track reordering&quot; option from the configuration page.</p> 
<p>

<h2>Aug. 20, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; New ENCODE Integrated Regulation super-track released</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of the ENCODE Integrated Regulation super-track, a collection
of regulatory tracks containing state-of-the-art information about the mechanisms that turn genes on
and off at the transcription level. Individual tracks within the set show enrichment of histone 
modifications suggestive of enhancer and promoter activity, DNAse clusters indicating open 
chromatin, regions of transcription factor binding, and transcription levels. When viewed in 
combination, the complementary nature of the data within these tracks has the potential to greatly 
facilitate our understanding of regulatory DNA.</p> 
<p> 
The data comprising these tracks were generated from hundreds of experiments on multiple cell lines 
conducted by labs participating in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, and were 
submitted to the UCSC ENCODE Data Coordination Center for display on the Genome Browser.</p> 
<p> 
Faced with the problem of how to display such a large amount of data in a manner facilitating 
analysis, UCSC has developed new visualization methods that cluster and overlay the data, and then 
display the resulting tracks on a single screen. Each of the cell lines in a track is associated 
with a particular color. Light, saturated colors are used to produce the best transparent 
overlay.</p> 
<p> 
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=Example1&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hg18EncReg"><img src="/images/encodeRegShot.gif" 
alt="ENCODE Regulatory track screenshot" width="622" height="167"></a></p> 
<p> 
The data in the ENCODE Regulation super-track, as with all data from the production phase of the 
ENCODE project, have genome-wide coverage. In general, Genome Browser tracks that show 
ENCODE-generated data can be identified by the double-helix icon preceding the name in the track 
list. Currently, the ENCODE Regulation data are available only on the Mar. 2006 (NCBI Build 36, UCSC
version hg18) assembly of the human genome.</p> 
<p> 
For a detailed description of the datasets contained in this super-track and a discussion of how the
tracks can be used synergistically to examine regions of regulatory functionality within the genome,
see the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&c=chr1&g=wgEncodeReg">track description</a> page.</p>

<h2>Jul. 23, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; BigBed/BigWig paper published</h2> 
<p>
Last summer, we announced the release of new data formats for very large data sets: BigBed and 
BigWig. Read more about these data formats 
<a href="https://lists.soe.ucsc.edu/pipermail/genome-announce/2009-July/000165.html" 
target="_blank">here</a>. As a follow up, we are pleased to announce that we have published a paper 
on these new file formats:  Kent WJ, Zweig AS, Barber G, Hinrichs AS, Karolchik D. 
<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btq351" 
target="_blank">BigWig and BigBed: enabling browsing of large distributed data sets.</a> 
<em>Bioinformatics</em>. 2010 July 17. Published online in advance of print.</p> 
<p>
From the abstract: &quot;BigWig and BigBed files are compressed binary indexed files containing data
at several resolutions that allow the high-performance display of next-generation sequencing 
experiment results in the UCSC Genome Browser. The visualization is implemented using a 
multi-layered software approach that takes advantage of specific capabilities of web-based protocols

<p> 
UCSC is pleased to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the debut of the first assembled human 
genome sequence and its then-fledgling visualization tool, the UCSC Genome Browser. Released on 
July 7, 2000, the genome sequence instantly created unprecedented web traffic on the ucsc.edu domain
as researchers around the world scrambled to download the data: 0.5 terabytes per day, a
record that stood for many years.</p>  
<p> 
David Haussler recounts that day: &quot;Seeing the waterfall of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts pouring off our 
server was an emotional moment. We were witnessing the product of more than three billion years of 
evolution, sequences passed down from the beginning of life to present-day humans.&quot; 
<sup>1</sup></p>
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group is proud of the role we have played in bringing the human 
genome, as well as the genomes of many other species, to the world. We'd like to thank NHGRI, HHMI,
and our other funding agencies for making this service possible, and also our many users and 
collaborators for their suggestions, contributions, and support throughout the years. We look 
forward to serving as a reliable source of bioinformatics tools and genomic annotations in the years
to come while facing the exciting challenges presented by rapidly advancing technology.</p>

<h2>May 6, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; UCSC hosts portal for Neandertal sequence, alignments, and
analyses</h2> 
<p> 
In conjunction with the publication of the paper Green <em>et al.</em> 
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5979/710" target="_blank">A Draft Sequence 
of the Neandertal Genome</a> in the May 7 issue of <em>Science</em>, the UCSC Genome Browser project
has released a public <a href="../Neandertal">Neandertal portal</a> that may be used to access the 
Neandertal sequence, alignments to the UCSC hg18 (NCBI Build 36) human reference assembly and the 
UCSC panTro2 (Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium v2.1) chimpanzee reference assembly, and
several associated analyses.</p>  
<p> 
Neandertals are the closest extinct relatives of humans. They lived in much of Europe and western 
Asia before disappearing from the fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago. The Neandertal 
genome sequence consists of short sequence fragments, usually about 50 base pairs long, mapped to 
the human reference genome. The sequence was derived primarily from DNA extracted from three 
Neandertal bones, each about 40,000 years old, found in the Vindija Cave in Croatia; smaller amounts
of data were also obtained from three bones from other sites. The bulk sequencing was carried out on
the Illumina GAII platform.  Neandertal DNA was differentiated from the background of microbial 
sequences in the bone by similarity to the human or chimpanzee genomes.</p> 
<p> 
The draft sequence of the Neandertal genome yields important new insights into the evolution of 
modern humans. Among the findings discussed in the <em>Science</em> publication is evidence that 
some early modern humans, after their migration out of Africa, interbred with Neandertals, resulting
in traces of Neandertal DNA sequences in the genomes of present-day non-Africans. The authors also 
cataloged genetic features unique to modern humans by comparing the Neandertal, human, and 
chimpanzee genomes. Among the genes highlighted in the study as likely to have undergone important 
changes in recent human evolution are those involved in cognitive development, skull structure, 
energy metabolism, skin morphology and physiology.</p>  
<p> 
We'd like to thank Richard Green (formerly of the Max-Planck Institute, and now an assistant 
professor of biomedical engineering at UCSC) and the many authors of the <em>Science</em> paper for 
providing the UCSC Genome Browser with these data. We'd also like to acknowledge the hard work of 
the UCSC Genome Browser staff who pulled together the annotations and information for the UCSC 
Neandertal portal: Angie Hinrichs, Katrina Learned, and Pauline Fujita.</p>

<h2>Feb. 24, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; New gene name search functionality released</h2> 
<p> 
UCSC has introduced a new gene search functionality in the Genome Browser, available through a 
&quot;gene&quot; text box on the gateway and annotation tracks pages. If you are searching for a 
particular gene, but you don't remember the exact coordinates, simply type the gene name into the 
box. The software will suggest gene names as you type; you can either choose a gene from the list, 
or finish typing your full gene name and then press &quot;jump&quot; or press enter. This 
functionality is available now&mdash;there's nothing to configure. Start using it 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway">here</a>.</p>
<p>

<h2>Jan. 25, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; New custom track type: Binary Alignment/Map (BAM)</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the availability of another new track type for Custom Tracks: the Binary 
Alignment/Map (<a href="help/bam.html">BAM</a>).</p> 
<p> 
BAM is the compressed binary version of the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/" 
target="_blank">Sequence Alignment/Map</a> (SAM) format, a compact and index-able representation of 
nucleotide sequence alignments. Many next-generation sequencing and analysis tools work with 
SAM/BAM. For custom track display, the main advantage of indexed BAM over PSL and other 
human-readable alignment formats is that only the portions of the files needed to display a 
particular region are transferred to UCSC. This makes it possible to display alignments from files 
that are so large that the connection to UCSC would time out when attempting to upload the whole 
file to UCSC. Both the i BAM file and its associated index file remain on your web-accessible server
(http or ftp), not on the UCSC server. UCSC temporarily caches the accessed portions of the files 
to speed up interactive display.</p>

<a name="011310"></a>
<h2>Jan. 13, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; Lifespan of custom tracks within sessions</h2> 
<p> 
Due to the popularity of UCSC <a href="help/hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom tracks</a> and 
<a href="help/hgSessionHelp.html">sessions</a>, we are running out of disk space for storing custom 
tracks accessed within sessions. Although sessions themselves are saved for one year, user-generated
tracks within sessions (including custom tracks) are saved for 48 hours, the typical period for 
other custom tracks. Until now, because we have had space available on the server, we have 
attempted to keep custom tracks alive for the lifetime of the session.</p> 
<p> 
While we provide short-term custom track storage as a service to users who want to view their own 
data in the UCSC Genome Browser, we unfortunately do not have the resources to guarantee long-term 
data storage. Over the next few days, we will begin to actively delete custom tracks within sessions
that have not been accessed within the past four months. If you actively use your custom tracks 
within saved sessions, they will not be deleted.</p> 
<p> 
Instead of uploading your data to our servers, please consider using alternate data types such as 
<a href="help/bigBed.html">bigBed</a>, <a href="help/bigWig.html">bigWig</a>, or other URL-based 
tracks that enable you to store your data locally.</p>

<h2>Jan. 11, 2010  &nbsp;&nbsp; Zebrafish release zv8 now available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The most recent zebrafish assembly -- zv8 (UCSC version danRer6, Dec. 2008) -- is now available in 
the UCSC Genome Browser. This assembly was produced by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK.</p> 
<p> 
The danRer6 assembly consists of nearly 1.5 billion bp in 11,623 scaffolds with a coverage of 
6.5-7x. It includes sequence anchored to chromosomes 1-25 and chrM (mitochondrial), as well as 
11,418 unplaced scaffolds. Significant problems existing in previous assemblies have been rectified 
in this assembly through the use of a whole-genome shotgun assembly with more coverage and a 
reorganization of the fingerprint contig order and orientation through more careful use of maps. 
For more information about this assembly, see the Sanger Institute web page for the

human assembly, we have changed the default human browser on our website from hg18 to hg19. In 
general, if you are currently using the hg18 (or older) browser, the Genome Browser will continue 
to display that assembly for you when you start it up. However, there are circumstances in which the
assembly may switch to the newer version (for instance, if you reset your browser defaults). If you 
find yourself in a situation where some of your favorite browser tracks have 
&quot;disappeared&quot;, you may want to check that you're viewing the right assembly.</p>

<h2>Dec. 1, 2009  &nbsp;&nbsp; New UCSC Genes and Conservation tracks released on hg19 browser</h2> 
<p> 
We're happy to announce the release of two of our most popular data sets on the hg19/GRCh37 human 
Genome Browser. The <strong>UCSC Genes</strong> track is a moderately conservative set of gene 
predictions based on data from RefSeq, Genbank, CCDS and UniProt. The <strong>Conservation</strong> 
track shows multiple alignments of 46 vertebrate species and measurements of evolutionary 
conservation using two methods (phastCons and phyloP) from the PHAST package for all vertebrate 
species as well as primate and placental mammal subsets. For more information about these 
annotations, read the description pages that accompany these tracks.</p>

<h2>Sep. 9, 2009  &nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to the bigBed/bigWig data formats</h2> 
<p>
If you have been taking advantage of the new bigBed format (for very large data sets), you'll be 
happy to hear that we have considerably slimmed down the memory footprint of the program that 
converts BED files into bigBed files: bedToBigBed. Because it now uses a multi-pass approach, it now
takes only 1/4 the amount of RAM as the size of the uncompressed BED input file (instead of the 5x 
RAM it needed previously!). Read more <a href="help/bigBed.html">here</a>. Pick up the new 
bedToBigBed executable 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/">here</a>.</p> 
<p> 
In conjunction with this change, there is also a change to the way you must specify your bigBed or 
bigWig custom track. When you specify the location of your local bigBed/bigWig file (on your 
web-accessible http, https, or ftp server), use the designation &quot;bigDataUrl&quot; instead of 
the old &quot;dataUrl&quot;:</p> 
<pre><code>track type=bigBed name="My Big Bed" description="Some Data from My Lab"
<strong>bigDataUrl</strong>=http://myorg.edu/mylab/myBigBed.bb</code></pre> 
<p> 
Additionally, we would like to announce a companion program to the previously-announced wigToBigWig 
program: bedGraphToBigWig. This program converts bedGraph files into bigWig files. The bedGraph 
format allows display of sparse or varying-size data.  Read more 
<a href="help/bigWig.html">here</a>. You can download the new bedGraphToBigWig utility 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/">here</a>.</p> 
<p> 
The main advantage of the bigBed and bigWig formats is that only the portions of the files needed to
display a particular region are transferred to UCSC, so for large data sets, displaying 
bigBed/bigWig data is considerably faster than regular BED/wig data. The bigBed/bigWig file remains 
on your web accessible server (http, https, or ftp), not on the UCSC server. Consequently, creating 
your custom track is very fast. Only the portion that is needed for the chromosomal position you are
currently viewing is locally cached at UCSC as a &quot;sparse file&quot;.</p>

<h2>Dec. 3, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated Horse Genome Browser available</h2> 
<p>
The Sep. 2007 EquCab2 release of the horse genome (Equus caballus) is now available in the UCSC 
Genome Browser. This assembly, UCSC version equCab2, was produced by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Broad Institute</a>. </p> 
<p> 
The horse draft genome has been sequenced to 6.8X coverage. Approximately 84% of the sequence has 
been anchored to chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-31 and sex chromosome X. Unanchored contigs 
that could not be localized to a chromosome have been concatenated into the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrUn&quot;, separated by gaps of 1,000 bp. The mitochondrial sequence is also available in 
the Genome Browser as the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;.

<h2>Nov. 7, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Medaka Genome Browser updated</h2> 
<p> 
We have updated the initial UCSC Medaka Genome Browser (oryLat1) to correct an error with chrUn in 
which the gap relationships between the contigs within their ultracontigs were incorrect. This error
was introduced by UCSC during the browser assembly process. The corrected replacement browser, 
oryLat2 (Oct. 2005), is based on the same v1.0 assembly produced by the National Institute of 
Genetics (NIG) and the University of Tokyo, Japan. We have removed the original oryLat1 assembly 
from the browser.</p>

<h2>Sep. 17, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Seven assemblies archived</h2> 
<p>
We have archived seven older assemblies of the human (hg15), mouse (mm5, mm6), rat (rn2), 
<em>C. elegans</em> (ce1), zebrafish (danRer2), and cow (bosTau1) genomes. You can continue to 
download these assemblies from the Genome Browser 
<a href ="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">downloads server</a>. At least two later 
assemblies for each of these organisms remain available on the main Genome Browser site.</p>

<h2>Sep. 3, 2008 - Updated UCSC Genes set released for hg18</h2> 
<p> 
We have released an updated UCSC Genes data set on the latest human assembly (hg18, Mar. 2006). 
The new annotation can be found on the hg18 Genome Browser in the &quot;Genes and Gene
Predictions&quot; track group. The previous set of UCSC Genes on the hg18 assembly has been renamed 
as Old UCSC Genes in the same track group.</p> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genes track shows gene predictions based on data from RefSeq, GenBank, CCDS and UniProt. 
This is a moderately conservative set of predictions, requiring the support of one GenBank RNA 
sequence plus at least one additional line of evidence. The RefSeq RNAs are an exception to this, 
requiring no additional evidence. The track includes both protein-coding and putative non-coding 
transcripts. Some of these non-coding transcripts may actually code for protein, but the evidence 
for the associated protein is weak. Compared to RefSeq, this gene set has generally about 10% more 
protein-coding genes, approximately five times as many putative non-coding genes, and about twice 
as many splice variants.</p> 
<p> 
The latest version of UCSC Genes explicitly incorporates CCDS proteins in addition to the evidence 
included in previous versions, as well as additional data from GenBank, RefSeq, and UniProt. 
Although we have made every effort to preserve UCSC Gene IDs across versions, some gene IDs have 
changed in the new data set. In general, the ID number has been incremented if the new version of a 
gene is larger than the previous version, and a completely new ID has been assigned in those 
instances where a splice site changed or the protein-coding region shrank. However, searching on an 
old discontinued ID from the previous gene set will take you to the corresponding gene in the 
updated track.  Alternatively, you can check the kg3ToKg4 table directly to find corresponding gene 
IDs.</p>
<p> 
The UCSC Genes set was produced by Jim Kent. Thanks to Ann Zweig for heading up the testing of the 
new data set, and to the entire Genome Browser QA team for coordinating its release on our public
site.</p>

<h2>Aug. 27, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Zebra Finch Genome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We've added the Jul. 2008 release of the zebra finch genome (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>) to our 
collection of vertebrate genome browsers. The v3.2.4 draft assembly (UCSC version taeGut1) was 
produced by the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) School 
of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, USA.</p> 
<p> 
The zebra finch genome is the second bird genome to be sequenced (following the chicken, 
<em>Gallus gallus</em>). The DNA used for the shotgun sequencing and the BAC and cosmid libraries 
was derived from a single male zebra finch. The initial assembly was generated using PCAP with 
approximately 6X coverage. About 1.0 Gb of the 1.2-Gb genome has been ordered and oriented along 33 
chromosomes and one linkage group. The chromosome names are based on their homologous chromosomes in
the chicken (<em>Gallus gallus</em>). For more assembly details, as well as a cross reference table 
of zebra finch and chicken chromosome names, see the WUSTL

<h2>May 5, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; GSID HIV data browser now available</h2> 
<p> 
Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases (GSID) has announced the launch of an HIV Data Browser with
clinical and viral sequence data from infected subjects in the VAX004 (North American/European) 
Phase III clinical trial of the AIDSVAX B/B vaccine. The browser, which is a customized version of 
the UCSC Genome Browser developed by the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group and hosted by GSID, 
provides researchers with searchable demographic and clinical data from volunteers who became HIV 
infected during the VAX004 trial. Using the browser, viral sequences may be aligned with one another
or with reference or consensus sequences.</p> 
<p> 
GSID is making these AIDSVAX data and serological samples available to the HIV research community 
through an agreement with VaxGen and with funding provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Future releases will include the addition of clinical and viral sequence data from infected subjects
in the VAX003 (Thai) Phase III clinical trial of AIDSVAX B/E, and immunogenicity data from infected 
subjects in both the VAX004 and VAX003 trials. The browser may be expanded to include data from 
uninfected subjects in both trials as well.</p>

<h2>Apr. 23, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Marmoset Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We'd like to announce the release of a Genome Browser and Blat server for the marmoset genome 
(<em>Callithrix jacchus</em>). The Jun. 2007 assembly -- WUSTL version Callithrix jacchus-2.0.2, 
UCSC version calJac1 -- was produced by Washington University St. Louis (WUSTL) School of Medicine 
Genome Sequencing Center in St. Louis, MO, USA.</p> 
<p> 
<em>C. jacchus</em>, a member of the New World monkey clade, is the most widely studied marmoset. It
is a popular non-human primate model due to its small body size and unique biological features, and 
has contributed to the study of brain function, immunity, reproductive biology and drug toxicity. 
<em>C. jacchus</em> marmosets typically give birth to twins that are somatic chimeras, i.e. each 
sibling is the mixture of sibling genotypes. (Excerpted from the WUSTL <em>C. jacchus</em> 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Callithrix%20jacchus" 
target="_blank">project</a> page.)</p> 
<p> 
The <em>C. jacchus</em> genome was sequenced to 6X coverage using DNA from a female marmoset 
provided by the Southwestern National Primate Research Center in San Antonio, TX, USA. DNA from a 
full brother of the female was used as the source for the CHORI-259 BAC library. This assembly is 
composed of 49,724 supercontigs containing a total of approximately 3.02 billion bases. For more 
statistics and details on the assembly process, refer to the WUSTL Callithrix_jacchus-2.0.2

<h2>Apr. 15, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Introducing the Archaeal Genome Browser Database</h2> 
<p> 
We'd like to introduce the Archaeal Genome Browser Database, a visualization tool and an integrated 
repository for archaeal functional genomics data. This resource was developed by the 
<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Lowe Lab</a> in the UCSC Biomolecular Engineering
Department, with key assistance from the UCSC Genome Browser team. The Archaeal Genome Browser 
Database home page can be accessed via the <a href="http://archaea.soe.ucsc.edu/" 
target="_blank">Archaeal Genomes</a> menu link on the Genome Browser home page.</p> 
<p> 
Currently there are more than 50 completed archaeal genomes, the least studied domain of life. 
Although archaea and bacteria are both prokaryotes, often co-existing in the same environments, many
aspects of archaeal cell biology such as DNA replication, repair, transcription, and translation are
homologous to those found in eukaryotes. Some members of archaea are also notable for inhabiting 
extreme environments, including boiling terrestrial hot springs, black smoker vents at the bottom of
the ocean, the ultra briny water of the Dead Sea, and highly acidic drainage water from ore mines, 
to name a few.</p> 
<p> 
The Archaeal Genome Browsers offer a variety of basic tracks derived from Genbank RefSeq annotation,
along with published genome analyses from the Lowe Lab and external groups. The annotations include 
operon predictions, regulatory sequence motifs (promoters and Shine-Dalgarno), microarray data, 
multi-genome alignments, and protein conservation across major phylogenetic groups.</p> 
<p> 
The goal of the Lowe Lab is to make the Archaeal Genome Browser Database a forum for ongoing 
community-based genome annotation, and they welcome new experimental and bioinformatic analyses. If 
you would like to contribute data, or have questions or feedback about the database, contact 
<a href="mailto:&#108;o&#119;&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;&#100;&#117;">Todd Lowe</a>.</p>

<h2>Apr. 8, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated Cow Genome Browser now available</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the Oct. 2007
draft assembly of the Cow genome <em>Bos taurus</em>. This assembly (UCSC version bosTau4) was 
produced by the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) as Baylor 
release Btau_4.0.</p> 
<p> 
The Btau_4.0 release was produced using the 
<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/721">Atlas</a> genome assembly system at 
BCM HGSC. The sequencing strategy combined BAC shotgun reads with whole genome shotgun reads from 
small insert libraries as well as BAC end sequences. The assembly contains chromosomes 1-29 and X 
as well as 11869 scaffolds (named chrUn.004.*). The mitochondrial sequence (available in the browser
as &quot;chrM&quot;) was obtained from GenBank accession GI:60101824.</p> 
<p> 
The Btau_4.0 assembly was tested against available bovine sequence data sets (EST sequences and 
finished BAC sequences) for extent of coverage (completeness). When assembled contigs were tested, 
over 95% of the sequences in these data sets were found to be represented, indicating that the 
shotgun libraries used to sequence the genome were comprehensive. Of the 1.04 million EST sequences 
95.0% were contained in the assembled contigs. Assuming the ESTs are uniformly distributed 
throughout the genome, the estimated genome size is 2.73Gb/95% = 2.87Gb. For detailed information 
on the sequencing and assembly techniques, see the Baylor 
<a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/" target="_blank">Bovine Genome Project</a> web
page.</p>

<h2>Mar. 10, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; Orangutan Genome Browser now available</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the Jul. 2007
draft assembly of the Sumatran orangutan genome, <em>Pongo pygmaeus abelii</em>. This assembly 
(UCSC version ponAbe2, WUSTL version Pongo_albelii-2.0.2) was provided by the Genome Sequencing 
Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSTL), MO, USA.</p> 
<p> 
The orangutan genome was sequenced to 6X coverage using a female orangutan known as 
&quot;Susie&quot; from the Gladys Park Zoo (Brownsville, TX, USA). The combined sequence reads were 
assembled using <a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/9/2164" 
target="_blank">PCAP</a> and filtered for all known non-orangutan sequence contaminants. For more 
details about the assembly, see the orangutan browser

<h2>Mar. 7, 2008 &nbsp;&nbsp; New reverse functionality released</h2> 
<p>
The Genome Browser team is happy to announce new functionality in the main Genome Browser track 
display. A new configuration button, &quot;Reverse,&quot; now allows users to view the entire 
browser image flipped right-to-left. This is especially useful when a user's gene of interest aligns
on the opposite strand from the reference assembly. Those genes then appear in the 5' to 3' 
direction.</p>
<p> 
When the reverse function has been activated, all of the track labels usually displayed on the left 
side of the track (including the mini-button providing access to configuration options) are 
displayed on the right side. This allows users to see at a glance which direction is being 
displayed. All navigation options operate as expected.</p> 
<p> 
Thanks to Mark Diekhans, Ann Zweig, Robert Kuhn and the rest of the engineering team for 
implementing this feature.</p>

<h2>Oct. 15, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser for Zebrafish Zv7 released</h2> 
<p> 
The latest zebrafish assembly -- Zv7 (UCSC version danRer5, July 2007) -- is now available in the 
UCSC Genome Browser. The Zv7 assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in 
collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tuebingen, Germany, and the
Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, The Netherlands.</p>
<p> 
This assembly consists of 1,440,582,308 bp in 5,036 fragments. It includes sequence anchored to 
chromosomes 1-25 and chrM (mitochondrial), as well as 5010 unplaced scaffolds. The assembly was 
produced by integrating finished clone sequence from the physical map with whole genome shotgun 
assembly sequence. The N50 size is 1,153,933, n = 277 (i.e. the length such that 50% of the 
assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer). For more information about this 
assembly, see the Sanger Institute web page for the

<h2>10 Oct. 10, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Browser for Purple Sea Urchin</h2> 
<p> 
The Sep. 2006 release of the purple sea urchin genome (<em>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</em>) is 
now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This assembly, UCSC version strPur2, was produced by the 
Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) and corresponds to their 
Spur_2.1 assembly.</p>  
<p> 
The Spur_2.1 release was assembled from BAC sequence reads (approximately 2x coverage) and whole 
genome shotgun reads (6x coverage), and utilizes BAC tiling path information. The BCM HGSC 
Atlas-2.0 genome assembly system was used to generate this assembly. The total length of all contigs
greater than 1kb is 804 Mbp.  When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the total 
span of the assembly is 907 Mbp. The estimated size of the genome based on the assembly is 814 
Mbp.</p> 
<p> 
Compared to previous sea urchin releases, the Spur_2.1 assembly is more continuous and has fewer 
false duplications; contaminations identified in the previous Spur_2.0 assembly have been removed.  
This draft assembly may contain errors; therefore, users should exercise caution. Typical errors may
include misassemblies of repeat sequences, collapses of repeat regions, and artificial duplications 
in polymorphic regions. However, base accuracy in contigs is usually very high with most errors near
the ends of contigs.</p> 
<p>

<h2>Oct. 4, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; ENCODE Genome Browser Released for hg18 Assembly</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC ENCODE browser for the human genome assembly hg18 (NCBI Build 36) is now available. You can
access the browser directly at
<a href="../ENCODE/encode.hg18.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/encode.hg18.html</a> or by 
clicking the ENCODE link in the sidebar menu on this page, then clicking the Regions (hg18) link in 
the sidebar menu on the ENCODE portal page.</p> 
<p> 
The hg18 ENCODE browser includes 540 data tables in 59 browser tracks that were migrated from the 
hg17 browser. The hg17 data coordinates were converted to hg18 coordinates using the UCSC liftOver 
process.</p> 
<p> 
To improve the accessibility of the data, related ENCODE tracks have been gathered into new 
configuration groupings (&quot;super-tracks&quot;) that can be displayed or hidden using a single 
visiblity control. We have also reduced the number of track groups and have modified some of the 
group names for clarity. ENCODE tracks with whole-genome data have been moved into the standard 
browser track groups.</p> 
<p> 
For more information about the hg18 ENCODE data migration, see the News section on the UCSC 
<a href="../ENCODE/">ENCODE portal page</a> and the UCSC 
<a href="http://genomewiki.soe.ucsc.edu/index.php/ENCODE_Hg18_Migration"

<h2>Aug. 22, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Mouse Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
The latest mouse genome assembly from the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium, NCBI Build 37.1, is 
now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This version (UCSC version mm9) is considered to be 
essentially finished.</p>
<p> 
The Build 37.1 assembly includes approximately 2.6 Gb of sequence on chromosomes 1-19, X, Y, M 
(mitochondrial DNA) and Un (unmapped clone contigs). In-depth information about this assembly will 
become available on the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001635.16/"
target="_blank">NCBI website</a>. On chromosome Y in this assembly, only the short arm has reliable 
mapping data; therefore, most of the contigs on the Y chromosome are unplaced.</p> 
<p> 
The mm9 sequence and annotation data may be downloaded from the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/">FTP server</a> or 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/">Downloads</a> web page. The mm9 annotation 
tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. NOTE: To expedite the availability of the
mm9 browser on our website, the initial release does not contain the comparative genomics 
annotations. These will be added to our website as they become available. Also, note that the UCSC 
mm9 database contains only the reference strain C57BL/6J.</p>
<p> 
We'd like to thank Deanna Church and the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium for this assembly. 
We'd also like to acknowledge the work of the UCSC mm9 team: Hiram Clawson, Archana Thakkapallayil, 
Robert Kuhn, and Donna Karolchik. For a complete list of the individuals and organizations who 
participated in this assembly, see the <a href="credits.html#mouse_credits">Credits</a> page.</p>

<h2>Jul. 13, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> Release 5 now available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The latest <em>D. melanogaster</em> assembly can now be viewed in the UCSC Genome Browser. This 
version -- Release 5, dated Apr. 2006 (UCSC version dm3) -- was provided by the 
<a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project</a> (BDGP) and
combines both euchromatic and heterochromatic sequence. The Release 5.1 annotations (Mar. 2007) were
provided by <a href="http://flybase.net" target="_blank">FlyBase</a>.</p>  
<p> 
The six euchromatic arms in this assembly were sequenced and assembled by BDGP from a combination of
BAC and whole genome shotgun data, and have been finished to high quality.  All euchromatic sequence
have been compared to the restriction digest fingerprints in multiple enzymes for validity. The 
details of this analysis will be described in a forthcoming publication.</p> 
<p> 
Heterochromatic sequence from the <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/" target="_blank">Drosophila 
Heterochromatin Genome Project</a> (DHGP) are also available in this assembly. Scaffolds that could 
not be unambiguously mapped to a chromosome arm have been concatenated into chrUn. chrUextra 
contains small scaffolds produced by the Celera shotgun assembler that could not be consistently 
joined with larger scaffolds. Because some of the chrUextra data are of low quality, researchers are
encouraged to contact either BDGP or DHGP for further details on this resource. For more information
on this assembly, see the Release 5 <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/README.RELEASE5" 
target="_blank">assembly release notes</a>.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/">FTP server</a> or

thank the BDGP, DHGP, and Flybase for providing data for this release. The dm3 Genome Browser was 
produced by Angie Hinrichs, Archana Thakkapallayil, Kayla Smith, and Donna Karolchik. The 
<em>D. melanogaster</em> browser annotations were generated by FlyBase, DHGP, and the UCSC Genome 
Bioinformatics group. See the <a href="credits.html#dm_credits">Credits</a> page for a detailed list

annotation tracks for the Human March 2006 Genome Browser (hg18, NCBI Build 36). The new 
Conservation track displays multiple alignments of 27 vertebrate species aligned to the human 
genome, along with measurements of evolutionary conservation across all species in the alignment and
a separate measurement of conservation across the placental mammal subset of species in the 
alignment.</p> 
<p> 
The new track includes: 
<ul> 
  <li>
  5 new high-quality assemblies -- horse, platypus, lizard, and two fish (stickleback and
  medaka)</li> 
  <li>
  6 new low-coverage mammalian genomes -- bushbaby, tree shrew, guinea pig, hedgehog, common shrew, 
  and cat</li>  
  <li>
  6 updated assemblies -- chimp, cow, chicken, frog, fugu, and zebrafish</li> 
  <li>
  10 assemblies included in the previous version of the track -- rhesus, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, 
  armadillo, elephant, tenrec, opossum, and tetraodon</li> 
</ul>
<p> 
UCSC hosts browsers for the high-quality assemblies and the cat. Masked sequence data for the other 
genomes in the track are available from our downloads server.</p> 
<p> 
In addition to the expanded species list, the new Conservation track features the following 
improvements: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  additional filtering of pairwise alignments for each species to reduce paralogous alignments</li> 
  <li> 
  information about the quality of aligning species sequence included in the multiple alignment 
  downloads</li> 
  <li> 
  new track configuration buttons to assist in selecting which species to display</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
Bulk data downloads are available from the Genome Browser FTP server 
(<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/multiz28way">alignments</a>,

<h2>Jun. 13, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; ENCODE findings released to public</h2> 
<p> 
The findings of the ENCODE project have been released to the public today, the culmination of a 
four-year effort to catalog the biologically functional elements in 1 percent of the human genome. 
The publications, which include a group paper in the 14 June 2007 issue of 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html" 
target="_blank"><em>Nature</em></a> and 28 companion papers in the June 2007 issue of 
<a href="http://www.genome.org/content/vol17/issue6/" target="_blank"><em>Genome Research</em></a>, 
were authored by researchers from academic, governmental, and industry organizations located in 11 
countries. The <em>Nature</em> issue includes a pull-out poster featuring a screenshot of the UCSC 
Genome Browser displaying a broad range of the ENCODE data.</p> 
<p> 
In the <a href="http://genome.gov/25521554" target="_blank">press release</a> accompanying the 
publication rollout, NHGRI Director Francis S. Collins is quoted as saying &quot;This impressive 
effort has uncovered many exciting surprises and blazed the way for future efforts to explore the 
functional landscape of the entire human genome. Because of the hard work and keen insights of the 
ENCODE consortium, the scientific community will need to rethink some long-held views about what 
genes are and what they do, as well as how the genome's functional elements have evolved. This could
have significant implications for efforts to identify the DNA sequences involved in many human 
diseases.&quot;</p> 
<p> 
The main portal for the ENCODE data is the UCSC ENCODE Genome Browser. The analysis effort has been 
coordinated by <a href="http://wwww.ensembl.org/" target="_blank">Ensembl</a>. Much of the primary 
data have been deposited in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/ENCODE.html" 
target="_blank">NCBI GEO</a> and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/" target="_blank">EBI 
ArrayExpress</a> databases. To access the UCSC Genome Browser ENCODE portal, click the

<h2>Apr. 6, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; New UCSC Gene Prediction set released</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of a new gene prediction set, UCSC Genes, on the latest human
Genome Browser (hg18, NCBI Build 36). This annotation, which includes putative non-coding genes as 
well as protein-coding genes and 99.9% of RefSeq genes, is the next generation of the Known Genes 
set that UCSC has been providing for several years and supersedes the existing Known Genes 
annotation on the hg18 assembly.</p> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genes is a moderately conservative prediction set based on data from RefSeq, GenBank, and 
UniProt. Each entry requires the support of one GenBank RNA sequence plus at least one additional 
line of evidence, with the exception of RefSeq RNAs, which require no additional evidence. Some of 
the non-coding transcripts in the set may actually code for protein, but the evidence for the 
associated protein is weak at best. Compared to RefSeq, this gene set generally has about 10% more 
protein-coding genes, approximately five times as many putative non-coding genes, and about twice as
many splice variants.</p> 
<p> 
A new companion track to UCSC Genes, Alt Events, shows various types of alternative splicing, 
alternative promoter, and other events that result in more than a single transcript from the same 
gene. This track is based on an analysis by the txgAnalyse program of splicing graphs produced by 
the txGraph program.</p> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genes set is produced using a computational pipeline developed at UCSC by Jim Kent, Chuck 
Sugnet and Mark Diekhans. The programs used to construct the Alt Events data set were written by 
Jim Kent. For detailed information about the process used to construct the genes set, see the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&g=knownGene">track description page</a>. In upcoming months, 
we plan to release UCSC Genes sets on several organisms in addition to human. The UCSC Genes 
annotations will be updated approximately every three months.</p> 
<p> 
As part of this change, we are now using our own UCSC Genes accession numbers as the primary key 
into the underlying knownGene table, rather than the GenBank mRNA accessions we used in the previous
Known Genes prediction set.  Note that this may affect external sites with URLs that link into our 
genes track using the older-style accessions.</p> 
<p> 
We will continue to provide the older Known Genes track on hg18 under the name &quot;Old Known 
Genes&quot;. You may find the following tables useful in referencing the older gene set and 
converting between the two sets: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  knownGeneOld2: new name for table underlying the old Known Genes (previously called 
  knownGene)</li> 
  <li> 
  kgXrefOld2: new name for table that contains data for converting old Known Genes IDs to other IDs 
  (previously called kgXref)</li> 
  <li> 
  kg2ToKg3: data for converting old Known Genes IDs to the newer UCSC Genes IDs</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
We'd like to acknowledge the many people affiliated with the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group who 
worked hard to release this new annotation: developers Jim Kent, Mark Diekhans, and Fan Hsu (with 
technical support from several other engineers in the group); David Haussler; our splendid QA 
team -- Archana Thakkapallayil, Ann Zweig, Robert Kuhn, Kayla Smith, and Brooke Rhead; our build 
engineer -- Andy Pohl; and our sysadmin group. We'd also like to thank Chuck Sugnet for his input, 
the people and organizations maintaining the RefSeq, UniProt, and GenBank databases, and the 
scientists worldwide who have contributed to them. If you have any questions about this new release,

<h2>Mar. 27, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; Stickleback assembly released in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We have released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the Feb. 2006 v1.0 draft assembly of 
<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em> produced by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/" 
target="_blank">Broad Institute</a>.</p> 
<p> 
This assembly has been sequenced to approximately 6X coverage. An estimated  87% of the sequence has
been anchored to chromosomes (chrI - chrXXI). Of the remaining unanchored scaffolds, those that 
could be localized to a chromosome have been concatenated into the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrUn&quot; with 1000bp gaps between scaffolds. The stickleback mitochondrial sequence is also
available as the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/gasAcu1/">FTP server</a> or the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#stickleback">Downloads</a> page.These data 
have <a href="credits.html#stickleback_use">specific conditions for use</a>.</p> 
<p> 
The stickleback browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. See 
the <a href="credits.html#stickleback_credits">Credits</a> page for a detailed list of the 
organizations and individuals who contributed to this release.</p>

<h2>Feb. 16, 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp; New browser session-sharing function available</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of a new session management functionality in the Genome 
Browser, which allows users to save and share browser sessions.</p> 
<p> 
Users are now able to configure their browsers with specific track combinations, including custom 
tracks, and save the configuraton options. Multiple sessions may be saved for future reference, for 
comparison of scenarios or for sharing with colleagues. Saved sessions persist for one year after 
the last access, unless deleted. Custom tracks persist for at least 48 hours after the last time 
they are viewed.</p> 
<p> 
The new feature may be accessed via the &quot;Sessions&quot; link in the top blue bar in any 
assembly. To ensure privacy and security, users must login to the genomewiki site and create a 
username and password. Individual sessions may be designated by the user as either 
&quot;shared&quot; or &quot;non-shared&quot; to protect the privacy of confidential data.</p>
<p> 
To avoid having a new shared session from someone else override existing Genome Browser settings, 
users are encouraged to open a new web-browser instance or to save existing settings in a session 
before loading a new shared session.</p> 
<p> 
The Sessions feature was written by Angie Hinrichs of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group and 
released with the assistance of Kayla Smith and Robert Kuhn.</p>

<h2>Aug. 8, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Opossum assembly available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Browser now includes the latest draft assembly of the opossum genome. The Jan. 2006 
release of <em>Monodelphis domestica</em> (UCSC version monDom4) was sequenced and assembled by 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/opossum/" target="_blank">The Broad Institute</a>, 
Cambridge, MA, USA.</p> 
<p> 
This draft, which has approximately 6.5X coverage, has an assembly length of nearly 3.61 billion bp 
including gaps (3.50 billion bp without gaps) contained on chromosomes 1-8, X, and Un. The N50 of 
the genome including gaps is 104,359 bp; the N50 without gaps is 107,990. The N50 size is the length
such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.</p> 
<p> 
The monDom4 sequence and annotation data can be downloaded from the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/monDom4/"> FTP server</a> or 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/monDom4/">Downloads</a> page. Please review the 
<a href="credits.html#opossum_use">guidelines</a> for using the opposum assembly data.</p> 
<p> 
Many thanks to The Broad Institute for providing these data. The UCSC opossum Genome Browser was

<h2>Aug. 1, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; v2.1 Chicken assembly available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We have updated the Chicken Genome Browser to include the May 2006 v2.1 assembly (UCSC version 
galGal3) produced by the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University School of Medicine 
in St. Louis, MO, USA (WUSTL). The source of this sequence was a female inbred Red Jungle Fowl 
(<em>Gallus gallus</em>), the ancestor of domestic chickens. The chicken genome is the first of the 
avian genomes to be sequenced.</p>
<p> 
In this assembly, 198,000 additional reads covering all contig ends and regions of low quality have 
been added to the original assembly's 6.6X coverage. Approximately 95% of the sequence has been 
anchored to chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-24, 26-28, and 32, and sex chromosomes W and Z. 
(In contrast to mammals, the female chicken is heterogametic (ZW) and the male is homogametic (ZZ).)
The remaining unanchored contigs that could be localized to a chromosome have been concatenated into
the virtual chromosomes &quot;chr*_random&quot;, separated by gaps of 10,000 bp.  Unanchored contigs
that could not be localized to a chromosome have been concatenated into the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrUn_random&quot;, separated by gaps of 100 bp to reduce the total size of chrUn_random. The 
chicken mitochondrial sequence is also available as the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;.</p> 
<p> 
Although centromere positions are indicated on this assembly, little is known of their exact 
sequence. The centromeres of 18 chromosomes were tentatively localized based on FISH hybridization 
using BAC clones, genetic markers flanking the centromeres in coordination with mapping gaps in the 
physical map, repetitive sequence content, and analysis of proximity to the constrictions of the 
mitotic metaphase chromosomes. For more information on the process used to create the chromosomal 
sequences and assign centromere locations, see the WUSTL 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/detail/gallus-gallus/" target="_blank">Gallus gallus 
genome</a> page.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the chicken sequence and annotations may be obtained from the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/galGal3/">FTP server</a> or

<a href="credits.html#chicken_use">specific conditions for use</a>.</p>
<p>
We'd like to thank WUSTL, who provided the sequence, physical map, assembly, and assembly/map for 
this release. The genetic mapping and linkage analysis were produced through a collaborative effort 
of labs in The Chicken Mapping Consortium. The chicken browser annotation tracks were generated by 
UCSC and collaborators worldwide. See the <a href="credits.html#chicken_credits">Credits</a> page

<h2>Jul. 20, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Chimpanzee Genome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We are happy to announce the release of a Genome Browser for the latest release of the chimpanzee 
(Pan troglodytes) genome. The Mar. 2006 assembly -- labeled Chimp Build 2 Version 1 (UCSC version 
panTro2) -- was produced by the 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pan%20troglodytes&SECTION=collaborators" 
target=_BLANK>Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium</a>.</p> 
<p>
This 6X whole genome assembly contains sequence from the initial 4X chimpanzee assembly described 
and analyzed in <em>Nature</em> 
(<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html" target="_blank">The
Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</a>), with additional 2X sequence generated, 
assembled, and assigned to chromosomes by the 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pan%20troglodytes" 
target=_BLANK>Genome Sequencing Center of Washington University School of Medicine</a>, St. Louis, 
MO, USA.</p> 
<p> 
The whole genome shotgun data were derived primarily from the donor Clint, a captive-born male 
chimpanzee from the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta, GA, USA. The reads were assembled 
using the whole-genome assembly program PCAP. For information about the assembly process, see the 
panTro2 <a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=panTro2">Gateway</a> page. </p> 
<p> 
This assembly covers about 97 percent of the genome and is based on 6X sequence coverage. It is 
composed of 265,882 contigs with an N50 length of 29 kb and 44,460 supercontigs with an N50 length 
of 9.7 Mb. The total contig length, not including estimated gap sizes, is 2.97 Gb. Of that total, 
2.82 Gb of sequence have been ordered and oriented along specific chimpanzee chromosomes, 107 Mb 
have been placed in chr*_random, and 50 Mb remain in chrUn.</p> 
<p> 
A major difference between this assembly and the previous Nov. 2003 version is the chromosomal 
numbering scheme, which  has been changed to reflect a new standard that preserves orthology with 
human chromomes. Proposed by 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15218271&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum" 
target="_blank">E.H. McConkey</a> in 2004, the new numbering convention was subsequently endorsed by
the International Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium. This standard assigns the 
identifiers &quot;2a&quot; and &quot;2b&quot; to the two chimp chromosomes that fused in the human 
genome to form chromosome 2. Note that the genome assembly shown in the Nov. 2003 panTro1 Genome 
Browser retains the older numbering scheme, in which these chromosomes are numbered 12 and 13.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro2/">FTP server</a> or the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#chimp">Downloads</a> page. The complete set 
of sequence reads is available at the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces" 
target="_blank">NCBI trace archive</a>. These data have <a href="credits.html#chimp_use">specific 
conditions for use</a>.</p>

We'd like to thank the International Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, Washington 
University at St. Louis School of Medicine Genome Sequencing Center, and the Broad Institute for 
providing this sequence. We'd also like to acknowledge the UCSC team who worked on this release: 
Kate Rosenbloom, Brian Raney, Hiram Clawson, Ann Zweig, Archana Thakkapallayil, and Donna Karolchik.

<h2>Jun. 20, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser released for Baylor v3.4 Rat assembly</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group has released a Genome Browser for the v3.4 rat (<em>Rattus 
norvegicus</em>) genome. This assembly--UCSC version rn4, November 2004--was produced by the Atlas 
group at <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/" target="_blank">Baylor Human Genome Sequencing 
Center</a> (HGSC) as part of the Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium.</p> 
<p> 
The sequence was assembled using a hybrid approach that combines the clone-by-clone and whole genome
shotgun methods. The assembly is a minor update to version 3.3 that spliced in 54.6 Mb finished BAC 
sequences; the overall statistics are unchanged from releases 3.0 to 3.4.</p> 
<p> 
The 3.x assemblies reflect several sequence additions and software improvements over the previous 
2.x assemblies, including the sequencing of over 1100 new BACs to cover gaps, an improved marker 
set from the Medical College of Wisconsin, a new FPC map from the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences 
Centre, and improved linking of bactigs. For detailed information and statistics about the 3.x 
assemblies, see the Baylor HGSC <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/rat/"

<h2>Jun. 12, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; Latest <em>X. tropicalis</em> assembly available in Browser</h2> 
<p> The v.4.1 <em>Xenopus tropicalis</em> assembly is now available on the UCSC Genome Browser. This
whole genome shotgun assembly (xenTro2, Aug. 2005) was generated by the U.S. DOE Joint Genome 
Institute (JGI) using the Jazz assembler. It contains 19,501 scaffolds with an average coverage of 
7.65X. Roughly half the genome is contained in 272 scaffolds, each of at least 1.56 Mb in 
length.</p> 
<p> 
In this release, some scaffolds showing homology to a known prokaryotic contaminant as well as 
non-cellular or vector contamination have been removed by the JGI and placed in a separate 
directory. The <em>X.  tropicalis</em> assembly will be improved over the coming year by additional 
sequencing of large insert clones, targeted gap closure, and the incorporation of physical and 
genetic mapping information as it becomes available.</p> 
<p> 
For more information about the 4.1 assembly, see the JGI 
<a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Xentr4/Xentr4.home.html" target="_blank"><em>X. tropicalis</em>

<h2>May 10, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; NCBI Mouse Build 36 released in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The latest mouse genome assembly from the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium, NCBI Build 36, is now 
available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This version (UCSC version mm8) is considered to be 
essentially finished.</p>  
<p> 
The Build 36 assembly includes approximately 2.6 Gb of sequence on chromosomes 1-19, X, Y, M 
(mitochondrial DNA) and Un (unmapped clone contigs). For in-depth information about the process used
to assemble this version, see the NCBI website.  On chromosome Y in this assembly, only the short 
arm has reliable mapping data; therefore, most of the contigs on the Y chromosome are unplaced.

<h2>Apr. 14, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; NCBI Build 36.1 human reference sequence available in browser</h2> 
<p> 
The latest human genome reference sequence assembly (NCBI Build 36.1, March 2006) is now available 
as database hg18 in the UCSC Genome Browser. This sequence, which was obtained from NCBI, was 
produced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium.</p> 
<p> 
The hg18 assembly contains four alternate haplotype regions: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  chr22_h2_hap1 -- an alternate chromosome 22 assembly that contains the CYP2D6 gene (NT_113959.1). 
  CYP2D6 is deleted in the reference assembly.</li> 
  <li> 
  chr5_h2_hap1 -- a chromosome 5 alternate assembly of the SMN1 gene region (NT_113801.1, 
  NT_113802.1).</li> 
  <li> 
  chr6_cox_hap1 -- an A1-B8-DR3 alternate haplotype assembly of the chromosome 6 MHC region based on
  sequence data from the COX library (NT_113891.1).</li>  
  <li> 
  chr6_qbl_hap2 -- an A26-B18-DR3 alternate haplotype assembly of the chromosome 6 MHC region based 
  on sequence data from the QBL library (NT_113892.1, NT_113893.1, NT_113894.1, NT_113895.1, 
  NT_113896.1, NT_113897.1).</li>

Institute MHC Haplotype Project</a> web site for additional information on the chr6 alternate 
haplotype assemblies.</p> 
<p> 
The Y chromosome in this assembly contains two pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) at chrY:1-2709520 and 
chrY:57443438-57772954. These sequences were taken from the corresponding regions in the X 
chromosome and are exact duplications of the X chromosome sequences.</p>

<h2>Mar. 6, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; Purple Sea Urchin genome assembly available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The Apr. 2005 release of the Purple Sea Urchin genome (<em>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</em>) is 
now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This assembly, UCSC version strPur1, was produced by the 
Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) and corresponds to their 
Spur_0.5 whole genome shotgun assembly.</p> 
<p> 
This release was assembled from whole genome shotgun reads using the Atlas genome assembly system 
at the BCM HGSC. Several whole genome shotgun libraries, with inserts of 2-6 kb, were used to 
produce the data. About 7 million reads were assembled, representing about 800 Mb of sequence and 
about 6x coverage of the (clonable) sea urchin genome. Highly repeated sequences were assembled 
separately into reptigs and merged into the genome assembly. Sequences from BAC clones were omitted 
from this assembly and will be placed in a subsequent version of the draft sequence.</p> 
<p> 
This is a draft sequence and may contain errors; therefore, users should exercise caution. Typical 
errors in draft genome sequences include misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of repeated 
regions, and unmerged overlaps (<em>e.g.</em> due to polymorphisms) creating artificial 
duplications. However, base accuracy in contigs (contiguous blocks of sequence) is usually very high
with most errors near the ends of contigs.</p> 
<p>

<h2>Feb. 9, 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Rhesus Macaque Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
The latest rhesus macaque (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) draft assembly&mdash;v.1.0, Mmul_051212&mdash;is
now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This version (UCSC rheMac2) was sequenced and assembled by
the Macaque Genome Sequencing Consortium led by the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome 
Sequencing Center, in collaboration with the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University 
School of Medicine in St. Louis and the J. Craig Venter Institute Joint Technology Center.</p> 
<p> 
The rhesus macaque follows the human and chimpanzee as the third primate and first Old World monkey 
to have its genome sequenced. Overall, the rhesus genome shares approximately 92 to 95 precent of 
its sequence with the human, compared with the chimp at 98 precent. Because of its genetic, 
physiologic, and metabolic similarities to the human and chimp, the rhesus is an ideal reference 
point for comparisons among the three primates.</p> 
<p> 
The groups in the Macaque Genome Sequencing Consortium produced preliminary assemblies of the 
genome data using different and complementary approaches. The resulting data were combined into a 
single, high-density 	&quot;melded&quot; assembly by a team at J. Craig Venter Institute. This 
collaboration made use of published rhesus maps, the BAC fingerprint map from the Michael Smith 
Genome Sciences Centre, and the human reference genome sequence. The v.1.0 assembly covers about 93 
percent of the rhesus genome. For more information about the rheMac2 assembly, see the Baylor 
<a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/rmacaque/" target="_blank">Rhesus Monkey Project</a>

<h2>Dec. 20, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; Dog Genome Browser update released</h2> 
<p> 
UCSC has updated the dog Genome Browser to include the May 2005 v2.0 assembly (UCSC version canFam2)
sequenced and assembled by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Agencourt Bioscience. The 
whole genome shotgun sequence is based on 7.6X coverage of the dog genome which includes more than 
98% of the euchromatic genome.</p>  
<p> 
The dog genome, which contains approximately 2.5 billion base pairs, is similar in size to the 
genomes of humans and other mammals. The boxer breed was selected for the initial sequencing effort,
based on the lower variation rate in its genome relative to other breeds. In addition to the boxer, 
samples from several other dog breeds were used to generate a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) to facilitate disease studies. The SNPs are available from the Broad Institute 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/ftp/pub/papers/dog_genome/snps_canfam2/" target="_blank">dog

<h2>Oct. 4, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated Cow Browser available</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the Mar. 
2005 Btau_2.0 draft assembly of the cow genome. This assembly (UCSC version bosTau2) was provided by
Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center in Houston, TX.</p> 
<p> 
The Btau_2.0 release was assembled from whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads using the Atlas genome 
assembly system. Several WGS libraries, with inserts of 2 - 4 kb and 4 - 6 kb, were used to produce 
the data. Approximately 23 million reads were assembled, representing about 17.7 Gb of sequence and 
6.2x coverage of the (clonable) bovine genome. Highly repeated sequences and BAC clones sequences 
were omitted from this assembly; these will be placed in a subsequent version of the draft sequence.

<h2>May 5, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Mouse assembly available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The latest mouse genome assembly from the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium, NCBI Build 34 (UCSC 
version mm6), is now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. In conjunction with this release, we have
archived mouse assemblies mm3 and mm4. All archived assemblies are available for download via our 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#mouse" target="_blank">downloads 
server</a>.</p> 
<p> 
The Build 34 assembly has an assembled length of approximately 2.6 Gb, of which about 1.9 Gb is 
finished sequence. Chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and X are finished in this build. To review in-depth 
statistics on the assembly, see the NCBI 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/contig/Build34.html" 
target="_blank">Build 34 Data</a> web page. NOTE: In the Genome Browser mm6 assembly, chrY_random 
erroneously contains a region duplicated from chrY. For more information about this issue, see the 
Genome Browser <a href="../FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download30">FAQ</a>. Please also note that the 
UCSC mm6 database contains only the reference strain C57BL/6J.</p> 
<p> 
The mm6 sequence and annotation data may be downloaded from the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm6/">FTP server</a> or 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm6/">Downloads</a> web page. The mm6 annotation 
tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p> 
<p> 
Mirror sites, please note: due to the size of the comparative genomics annotations in this assembly,
the data set requires an unusually large amount of disk space. If you regularly download updates of 
the mouse data to your site, you may want to examine your available disk space before adding the 
annotation database from this assembly and/or reschedule your download for a period of low activity 
on your server. The size of the mm6 annotation database directory 
($WEBROOT/goldenPath/mm6/database/) is approximately 93 GB. Including the related net and chains, 
the total size is 124 GB.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank Deanna Church and the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium for this assembly. We'd 
also like to acknowledge the work of the UCSC mm6 team: Hiram Clawson, Fan Hsu, Jennifer Jackson,

<h2>Mar. 2, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; CCDS Data set released</h2> 
<p> 
The initial results from the Consensus Coding Sequence project (CCDS) were released to the public 
today. CCDS is a collaborative effort to identify a core set of human protein-coding regions that 
are consistently annotated and of high quality.</p> 
<p> 
The initial CCDS data set, containing nearly 15,000 transcripts, has been posted on three Internet 
sites: the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg17">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, the 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/" target="_blank">Ensembl Browser</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/" target="_blank">NCBI CCDS Database</a> website. The 
genes may be viewed on the UCSC hg17 (May 2004) Human Genome Browser in the CCDS annotation track 
located in the Genes and Gene Prediction Tracks section.</p> 
<p> 
The CCDS gene set is built by consensus among the following collaborating organizations:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> (EBI)</li> 
  <li> 
  <a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Center for Biotechnology 
  Information</a> (NCBI)</li> 
  <li> 
  <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">University of California Santa Cruz</a>
  (UCSC)</li> 
  <li> 
  <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> (WTSI)</li>
</ul> 
<p> 
Each gene in the CCDS set is assigned a unique identifier and version number, e.g. CCDS234.1. The 
version number will be updated if either the CDS structure or the underlying genome sequence at that
location changes. The CCDS set will be mapped forward, with identifiers preserved, when the 
annotations or sequence update. Changes to existing CCDS genes will be done by collaboration 
agreement; no single group will change the set unilaterally. CCDS identifiers are included on 
relevant NCBI RefSeq and Entrez Gene records.</p> 
<p> 
Gene structure information is obtained from both curated and automated genes sources. The primary 
curation groups are the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/havana/" target="_blank">Havana</a> 
team at the WTSI and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/" target="_blank">RefSeq</a> 
annotation group at NCBI. In addition, manually curated information on chr14 (Genoscope) and Chr7 
(WUSTL) has been included from the <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Vega</a> 
database. The <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/" target="_blank">Ensembl</a> group and the RefSeq 
computational pipeline provide the automated data. Curated information is favored over automated 
information; the information must be consistent between the Hinxton (Vega/Ensembl) and NCBI groups 
and also pass UCSC's stringent QC requirements.</p> 
<p> 
At a minimum, a gene must meet three quality criteria to be included in the CCDS set:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  The coding region has a full-length annotation with an initiating ATG, a valid stop codon, and no 
  in-frame stop codons.</li> 
  <li> 
  Protein can be translated from the genome without frameshifts.</li> 
  <li> 
  Consensus splice-sites are used.</li>
</ul> 
<p> 
For more information on the process used to identify and evaluate CCDS genes, refer to the 
description page for the Genome Browser CCDS track. The number and type of quality tests performed 
may be expanded in the future, but includes analysis to identify putative pseudogenes, 
retrotransposed genes, consensus splice sites, supporting transcripts, and protein homology. The 
completeness of the CCDS gene set should improve as the curation and automated annotation processes 
mature and additional experimental validation is obtain for weakly-supported genes.</p> 
<p> 
UCSC would like to thank EBI, NCBI and WTSI for their collaboration in the release of these data. 
We would also like to acknowledge the efforts of the UCSC staff who worked on this project: Mark 
Diekhans, Robert Baertsch, Adam Siepel, Fan Hsu, and Robert Kuhn.</p>

<h2>Feb. 23, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Honeybee Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group has released a Genome Browser for a second honeybee assembly, 
Amel_2.0 (UCSC version apiMel2), produced by the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing 
Center.</p> 
<p> 
The assembly -- which is approximately 229 Mb in size including contig gaps -- was sequenced using 
a combined whole genome shotgun (WGS) and BAC clone approach. Overall sequence coverage is estimated
at 7.5x. In this assembly, scaffolds have been arranged into 17 linkage groups that are somewhat 
equivalent to chromosomes. For more information about the assembly, see the Baylor 
<a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/honeybee/" target="_blank">honeybee project</a> 
website.</p>  
<p> 
The apiMel2 sequence and annotation data can be downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/apiMel2/">FTP server</a> or 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#apiMel">downloads</a> page. Please see the

<h2>Feb. 17, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; Cow Genome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the Sep. 2004
Btau_1.0 draft assembly of the cow genome. This assembly (UCSC version bosTau1) was provided by 
Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center in Houston, TX.</p> 
<p> 
The Btau_1.0 release was assembled from whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads using the Atlas genome 
assembly system. Several WGS libraries, with inserts of 2 - 4 kb and 4 - 6 kb, were used to produce 
the data. Approximately 15 million reads were assembled, representing about 9 Gb of sequence and 3x 
coverage of the (clonable) bovine genome. Highly repeated sequences and BAC clones sequences were 
omitted from this assembly; these will be placed in a subsequent version of the draft sequence. The 
assembly contains approximately 450,000 scaffolds.</p> 
<p> 
For more information on the Btau_1.0 assembly, see the Baylor 
<a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/" target="_blank">Bovine Genome Project</a> web
page.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/bosTau1/">FTP server</a> or

Genome Browser collection include six Drosophila genomes, the honeybee, and <em>Anopheles 
gambiae</em>.</p>
<p> 
The Release 4 euchromatic sequence, 118.4 Mb in size, contains six euchromatic chromosome arms with 
a total of 23 sequence gaps. The assembly was validated in collaboration with the Genome Sciences 
Centre at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada, using fingerprint analysis of a 
tiling path of BACs spanning the genome.</p> 
<p> 
The Release 3.2 heterochromatic sequence is based on 20.7 Mb of Release 3 whole genome shotgun 
scaffolds from Celera that could not be assembled into the euchromatin arms, as well as a few 
BDGP-sequenced scaffolds. The scaffolds have been assigned to chromosomes where possible.</p> 
<p>

<h2>Jan. 18, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp; Opossum Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The opossum (<em>Monodelphis domestica</em>) is the latest vertebrate addition to the UCSC Genome 
Browser genome collection. The Oct. 2004 preliminary assembly -- UCSC version monDom1 -- was 
sequenced and assembled by <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/seq/" target="_blank">The Broad 
Institute</a>, Cambridge, MA, USA.</p>  
<p> 
This preliminary draft was assembled from 33,507,069 placed reads, and consists of 109,065 contigs 
containing a total of 3,492,108,230 bases.  There are 3,563,247,205 total bases in the 19,348 
scaffolds in the assembly, with 71,138,975 bases in the gaps between contigs within the scaffolds. 
The scaffolds range in size from 1,000 bases to 22,286,839 bases.</p> 
<p> 
The monDom1 sequence and annotation data can be downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser

<h2>Dec. 23, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated Zebrafish assembly (Zv4) now available</h2> 
<p> 
The latest zebrafish assembly -- Zv4 (UCSC version danRer2, June 2004) -- is now available in the 
UCSC Genome Browser and Blat server. The Zv4 assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger 
Institute in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tuebingen, 
Germany, and the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, 
The Netherlands. This assembly consists of 1,560,480,686 bp in 21,333 scaffolds with a sequence 
coverage of approximately 5.7x.  443 Mb of the assembly is from 2,828 finished clones and 121 Mb 
is from 1,272 unfinished clones.</p>  
<p> 
75% of the sequence was tied to the fingerprint contig (FPC) map, which provided a template for 
placing the unfinished sequence.  The remaining sequence was filled with whole genome shotgun (WGS) 
contigs using a combination of sequence alignment and BAC end positions.  The WGS contigs used in 
this assembly were identical to those used for the Zv3 assembly, but the FPC data and its 
integration with the WGS data has been considerably improved.</p> 
<p> 
The Sanger Institute notes that there is high level of misassembly present in this release due to 
the large amount of polymorphism in the DNA source. Highly variable regions within the genome posed 
assembly difficulties, most likely because the sequences originated from different haplotypes. For 
more information about this assembly, see the Sanger Institute web page for the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/" target="_blank"><em>Danio rerio</em> Sequencing 
Project</a>.</p>  
<p> 
In addition to the assembly improvements noted above, a new zebrafish repeat library was used to 
mask repeats in the danRer2 Genome Browser, resulting in a cleaner set of alignments containing 
considerably less &quot;noise&quot;.</p>  
<p> 
The danRer2 sequence and annotation data can be downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/danRer2/">FTP server</a> or

<h2>Oct. 8, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated Proteome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
UCSC has released v1.1 of the UCSC Proteome Browser. This updated version includes the following 
major enhancements:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  direct access to a Proteome Browser gateway via the &quot;Proteome Browser&quot; menu link on the 
  Genome Browser home page. The Proteome Browser gateway page prompts the user for a protein ID or 
  gene symbol, then directly starts up the Proteome Browser, eliminating the multiple Genome Browser
  steps required by the previous release.</li>
  <li>
  extended protein coverage that includes all proteins in the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL databases, rather 
  than just the human, mouse and rat protein sets included in the previous version.</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
In addition to providing direct access to the Proteome Browser, the v1.1 release preserves the 
existing tight coupling between the Proteome Browser and the Genome Browser for the human, mouse and
rat genomes. Users may still navigate between the Genome Browser Known Genes track and the Proteome 
Browser for quick, easy access to the details of a gene's genomic and proteomic sequence 
structures.</p> 
<p> 
The UCSC team who worked on the Proteome Browser update includes Fan Hsu, Robert Kuhn, Donna 
Karolchik and Tom Pringle. Please send comments or questions to our mailing list at

<h2>Sep. 10, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>T. nigroviridis</em> genome now available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The Genoscope v7 <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> genome assembly is now available in the UCSC Genome
Browser and Blat server. This assembly, UCSC version tetNig1 dated Feb. 2004, is the result of a 
collaboration between <a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/" target="_blank">Genoscope</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/tetraodon/background.html" target="_blank">Broad 
Institute</a> of MIT and Harvard.</p>  
<p> 
The v7 assembly was constructed using the whole genome shotgun (WGS) approach, resulting in a 
sequence coverage of about 7.9X. The assembly contains 45,609 contigs and 25,773 scaffolds 
generated by the Arachne program and covers more than 90% of the genome. Additional linking data 
were used to build ultracontigs and to organize the assembly into chromosomes. Genoscope estimates 
the size of the Tetraodon genome to be about 385 Mb.</p> 
<p>

<h2>Sep. 1,2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser released for <em>D. pseudoobscura</em> draft assembly</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the 
<em>Drosophila pseudoobscura</em> Freeze 1 draft assembly (Aug. 2003). This assembly, UCSC version 
dp2, was produced by the Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) at Baylor College of Medicine.</p> 
<p> 
Freeze 1 is a whole genome shotgun assembly produced using Baylor HGSC's assembly engine, Atlas. 
The assembly, which provides approximately 7x coverage of the euchromatic portion of the genome, 
contains 759 scaffolds. The scaffold N50 size is 1,018,646 bp. The total scaffold size for this 
assembly is 139.3 Mbp, with an average size of 184,465 bp. Due to an assembly error, four large 
scaffolds &quot;jumped&quot; chromosomes. These have been split into &quot;A&quot; and
&quot;B&quot; parts in the downloadable assembly files. See the gateway page for more 
information.</p> 
<p> 
Baylor HGSC has provided a

<h2>Aug. 10, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser released for <em>A. gambiae</em> draft genome</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the 
<em>Anopheles gambiae</em> v. MOZ2 draft genome sequence (Feb. 2003). This assembly -- UCSC version 
anoGam1 -- was produced by the International Anopheles Genome Project and downloaded from
Ensembl.</p>  
<p> 
The MOZ2 assembly is a 10x whole genome shotgun assembly. The assembled portion of the genome is 
about 278 Mbp in length with a total of 8,987 unique scaffolds, the largest scaffold being 23.1 Mbp.
Approximately 85% of the sequence has been assigned to chromosomal locations. Chromosome arms chr2L,
chr2R, chr3L, chr3R, and chrX are represented by 13, 49, 42, 28, and 10 large scaffolds 
respectively. No scaffolds have yet been assigned to the Y chromosome. The unassigned scaffolds, 
concatenated together in arbitrary order, can be found in the artificial unknown 
&quot;chromosome&quot; chrUn.</p>

<h2>Jul. 23, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>D. yakuba</em> added to Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome Browser and Blat server on a second 
species of fruitfly, <em>D. yakuba</em>. The April 2004 Release 1.0 of this genome (UCSC version 
droYak1) was sequenced and assembled by the Genome Sequencing Center, Washington University (WUSTL) 
School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p>  
<p> 
<em>D. yakuba</em> is closely related to the model organism, <em>D. melanogaster</em>, with which it
shared a common ancestor approximately 10 million years ago. The <em>D. yakuba</em> genome is 
largely alignable to the <em>D. melanogaster</em> genome, but differs sufficiently to offer an 
interesting study of sequence divergence between the two species. <em>D. yakuba</em> occupies a 
critical intermediate position among several Drosophila species that will facilitate evolutionary 
studies among the fruitflies. For information about the <em>D. yakuba</em> assembly and statistics, 
see the WUSTL Genome Sequencing Center

<h2>Jul. 16, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser released for mouse assembly NCBI Build 33</h2> 
<p> 
The latest mouse assembly -- Build 33 from NCBI (UCSC version mm5) -- is now available via the UCSC 
Genome Browser and Blat server. This assembly includes approximately 2.6 gigabases of sequence. 
Chromosome 11 is finished in Build 33; the Sanger Institute has provided a corresponding agp file. 
The whole genome N50 for this assembly is 22.3 Mb, in comparison to 17.7 Mb for the previous build. 
Please note: the UCSC mm5 assembly contains only the reference strain C57BL/6J.</p> 
<p> 
This assembly is a composite version in which phase 3 High Throughput Genome Sequence (HTGS) was 
merged with the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium v3 Whole Genome Shotgun Assembly (MGSCv3). The 
assembly was performed by NCBI using a &quot;combined&quot; tiling path that was created 
automatically for the most part, but was manually curated in places. This facilitated the placement 
of finished sequence in the context of the MGSCv3 assembly. Draft sequence was not included in this 
build: the slight increase in coverage gained by using this would have been offset by the increase 
in build errors.</p> 
<p> 
More information about Build 33 will be available soon in the NCBI 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html" target="_blank">assembly 
notes</a> and

tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank Deanna Church, Richa Agrawala, and the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium for 
this assembly. We'd also like to acknowledge the work of the UCSC mm5 team: Fan Hsu, Hiram Clawson,

<h2>Jul. 14, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser released for dog draft assembly v1.0</h2> 
<p> 
UCSC has released a Genome Browser and Blat server on the July 2004  v1.0 dog genome sequenced and 
assembled by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Agencourt Bioscience. The whole genome 
shotgun (WGS) sequence is based on 7.6X coverage of the dog genome, assuming a WGS assembly size of 
2.4 Gb. The assembly has an N50 contig length of 123 kb and an N50 supercontig length of
41.6 Mb.</p>  
<p> 
The dog genome, which contains approximately 2.5 billion base pairs, is similar in size to the 
genomes of humans and other mammals. The boxer breed was selected for the initial sequencing effort,
based on the lower variation rate in its genome relative to other breeds. In addition to the boxer, 
samples from nine other dog breeds, four wolves and a coyote are being used to generate an initial 
set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to facilitate disease studies. The SNPs should be 
available soon from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a>.</p> 
<p> 
For more information about the dog draft assembly, see the 
<a href="http://www.genome.gov/12511476" target="_blank">NHGRI press release</a>.</p>

<h2>May 28, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; UCSC Family Browser name changed to UCSC Gene Sorter</h2> 
<p> 
What's in a name? In an effort to clarify the role of the UCSC Family Browser, we have changed its 
name to the UCSC Gene Sorter. We think this name better describes this tool, which lets the user 
collect information on groups of genes that may be related in many different ways. The Gene Sorter 
provides a wealth of information on gene expression, protein homology (both within and across 
species), GO terms, and Pfam domains, cross links to many other databases, and much more.</p> 
<p> 
If you haven't already tried this tool, we encourage you to give it a spin. You'll find it at

<h2>Apr. 12, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; GNF Gene Expression Atlas 2 data now available</h2> 
<p> 
Expression data from the GNF Gene Expression Atlas 2 are now available on the July 2003 human genome
assembly on the UCSC web site. The data may be viewed graphically in the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgNear?db=hg16&near.order=expGnfAtlas2&near.col.gnfHumanAtlas2Id.vis=on">Family 
Browser</a> or via the GNF Atlas 2 track in the Genome Browser. The track data contain 2 replicates 
each of 61 mouse tissues and 79 human tissues run over Affymetrix microarrays.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) for providing 
the expression data underlying the browser displays. More information on the data will be available 
in the paper Su et al.  &quot;A gene atlas of the mouse and human protein-encoding transcriptomes&quot; 
(in press - <em>PNAS</em>).</p>

<h2>Mar. 10, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Announcing the UCSC Proteome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We are proud to announce a new addition to the UCSC family of genome browsing and analysis tools.
The UCSC Proteome Browser presents a rich set of useful protein properties as well as links to 
several protein and genomic data sources on the Web. For the first time, Genome Browser users can 
have both the genome and proteome worlds at their fingertips simultaneously. The browser is 
accessible from the Genome Browser via the &quot;Proteome Browser&quot; link on the details page of 
any gene in the Known Genes track. The initial release is available only on Human Build 34 (hg16); 
Proteome Browsers for the latest mouse and rat assemblies will follow.</p> 
<p> 
For each protein, the browser displays the corresponding genomic exon structure and its amino acid 
sequence. Several protein property tracks are aligned to the sequence to help a user pinpoint regions
of interest.  Additional properties are plotted with histograms against genome-wide protein data to 
highlight significant trends and anomalies.</p> 
<p> 
The Proteome Browser is tightly coupled with the UCSC Genome Browser and UCSC Gene Family Browser, 
allowing easy navigation among the tools. For example, clicking on an exon in the Proteome Browser 
tracks display brings up the Genome Browser tracks page showing the genomic region of the exon 
together with a wealth of relevant data. Similarly, clicking on the Proteome Browser's 
&quot;Family Browser&quot; link displays related gene family information.</p> 
<p> 
The v1.0 release of the browser offers a variety of data tracks, including amino acid and DNA 
sequence, exon boundaries, hydrophobicity, polarity, cysteine and predicted glycosylation sites, 
Superfamily/SCOP domains, and amino acid anomalies. In addition, the browser includes histograms of 
several properties on a genome-wide scale: pI, molecular weight, exon count, number of cysteines, 
InterPro domain counts, hydrophobicity, amino acid frequencies and anomalies.</p> 
<p> 
The Proteome Browser also provides links to a variety of external sites containing supplementary 
information on the protein, including SwissProt, InterPro and Pfam domains, 3-D structures at PDB 
and UCSF ModBase, and pathway maps of KEGG, BioCarta (CGAP), and BioCyc.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank SwissProt for sharing their high quality protein data and the pI calculation 
algorithm, as well as the other external data sites linked to by the Proteome Browser. We'd also 
like to acknowledge the hard work of Fan Hsu, lead engineer on the project, and Jim Kent, Tom 
Pringle, Donna Karolchik, and Robert Kuhn. The project received technical input, review and support 
from several other members of the UCSC Bioinformatics group.</p>

<h2>Mar. 1, 2004 - Chicken draft genome added to Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We've added the chicken genome to the collection of assemblies available in the UCSC Genome Browser 
and Blat Server. The Feb. 2004 assembly (UCSC version galGal2) was produced by the Genome Sequencing
Center at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The source of this sequence 
was a female inbred Red Jungle Fowl (<em>Gallus gallus</em>), the ancestor of domestic chickens. 
The chicken genome is the first of the avian genomes to be sequenced.</p>  
<p> 
The genome has been sequenced to 6.63X coverage. Approximately 88% of the sequence has been 
anchored to chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-24, 26-28, and 32, and sex chromosomes W and Z. 
(In contrast to mammals, the female chicken is heterogametic (ZW) and the male is homogametic (ZZ).)
The remaining unanchored contigs have been concatenated into the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrUn&quot;, separated by gaps of 10,000 bp. The chicken mitochondrial sequence is
also available as the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;.</p>  
<p> 
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis created the physical map for this release. 
Genetic mapping and linkage analysis were produced through a collaborative effort led by Martien 
Groenen at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.  SNP data based on three strains of domestic 
chickens will soon be available in GenBank from an international team of scientists led by the 
Beijing Genomics Institute in China and supported by the Wellcome Trust in Britain.</p> 
<p> 
The chicken is considered to be the premier non-mammalian vertebrate model organism. It plays an 
important role in the research of viruses and cancer, and is a primary model for the study of 
embryology and development. From an evolutionary standpoint, the chicken's position provides a good 
intermediate data point between mouse and fugu. Comparative genomics analyses between the chicken 
and other sequenced organisms should yield valuable information on the evolution of gene order and 
arrangement, thus improving our understanding of the structure and function of genes. /<p> 
<p> 
To facilitate comparative genomics studies, alignments of the chicken sequence to the human genome 
will be available in the Genome Browser later this week. Downloads of the comparative data are 
currently available through the Downloads page (see below).</p> 
<p> 
For more information about the release of the chicken genome assembly, see the NHGRI 
<a href="http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/11510730" target="_blank">press release</a>. Additional background
on the rationale behind the chicken genome sequencing effort can be found in the  
<a href="http://www.genome.wustl.edu/ancillary/data/whitepapers/Gallus_gallus_WP.pdf"
target="_blank">sequencing proposal</a>.</p>  
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the chicken sequence and annotations may be obtained from the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/galGal2/">FTP server</a> or 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#chicken">Downloads</a> page. These data 
have <a href="/goldenPath/credits.html#chicken_use">specific conditions for use</a>.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University School of Medicine in 
St. Louis, Wageningen University, and the Chicken Mapping Consortium for providing these data. 
The chicken browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. See the 
<a href="/goldenPath/credits.html#chicken_credits">Credits</a> page for a detailed list of 
acknowledgements. The UCSC Chicken Genome Browser was produced by Angie Hinrichs, Heather Trumbower,

<h2>Feb. 23, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Chimpanzee genome browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We are happy to announce the release of a Genome Browser and Blat server for the chimpanzee 
(<em>Pan troglodytes</em>). The 13 Nov. 2003 Arachne assembly -- labeled Chimp Build 1 Version 1 
(UCSC version panTro1) -- was produced by the Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium.</p> 
<p> 
This assembly covers about 95 percent of the genome and is based on 4X sequence coverage. It is 
composed of 361,782 contigs with an N50 length of 15.7 kb, and 37,849 supercontigs having an N50 
length of 8.6 Mb (not including gaps). The total contig length is 2.73 Gb, spanning 3.02 Gb. The DNA
donor for this genome assembly, &quot;Clint&quot;, is a captive-born West African chimpanzee 
(<em>Pan troglodytes verus</em>). 
<a href="http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/ChimpGenome2.pdf" 
target="_blank">Background information</a> on the chimp genome sequencing project and the 
<a href="http://www.genome.gov/11509418" target="_blank">initial news release</a> about the chimp 
assembly can be found on the NHGRI website.</p>  
<p> 
Research has indicated that the human and chimp genomes probably differ by approximately one
percent. Because of this close relationship between chimpanzees and humans, the assembly should 
facilitate comparative analyses of the two genomes that have not been possible with other species 
that have been sequenced to date.</p>  
<p> 
The initial release of the Chimp Browser provides several annotation tracks comparing the chimp and 
human genomes.  More comparative annotations will be added in upcoming weeks.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the chimp sequence and annotations may be obtained from the Genome Browser 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro1/">FTP server</a> or 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#chimp">Downloads</a> page. The complete set 
of sequence reads is available at the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces" 
target="_blank">NCBI trace archive</a>. Blat searches on chrUn_random are not supported in the 
initial release, but will be available soon.</p>  
<p> 
We'd like to thank NHGRI, the Broad Institute at MIT/Harvard, and Washington University at St. Louis
School of Medicine for providing this sequence, and LaDeana Hillier, Washington University School of
Medicine, and the Broad Institute for their work on the alignments. The chimpanzee browser 
annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p> 
<p> 
The UCSC team who worked on this release consisted of Kate Rosenbloom, Jim Kent, Hiram Clawson, 
Heather Trumbower, Robert Kuhn, Donna Karolchik, and the Genome Browser sysadmin team.</p>

<a name="021204"></a>
<h2>Feb. 12, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; New UCSC supported mirror site</h2> 
<p> 
The Genome Browser project now has a UCSC-supported mirror site that may be used during power or 
network outages on the UCSC campus. The mirror is located at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 
Milwaukee. The site will be updated regularly by UCSC with the latest data and software to closely 
replicate the main Genome Browser site at <a href="../index.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu</a>. 
Please continue to use the UCSC-based site for routine Genome Browser and Blat access.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank the Department of Physiology at the Medical College of Wisconsin -- and in 
particular Jeff Nie and Greg McQuestion -- for their resources and collaboration on this project. 
We'd also like to acknowledge the hard work of UCSC's Paul Tatarsky, who invested many hours in 
arranging the collaboration and setting up the mirror.</p>

<h2>Jan. 14, 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp; Yeast Genome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We are proud to add yeast (<em>S. cerevisiae</em>) to our growing list of genome assemblies. The 
study of brewer's yeast, the most basic eukaryotic model system, has led to important discoveries 
in a wide variety of areas, including metabolism, centromeres, recombination, cell division control,
meiosis and splicing.</p>  
<p> 
This assembly (UCSC version sacCer1) is based on sequence dated 1 Oct. 2003 in the 
<a href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/" target="_blank">Saccharomyces Genome Database</a> (SGD). The 
sequence, open reading frame (ORF), and gene annotations were downloaded from the site 
<a href="ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/data_download" 
target="_blank">ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/data_download</a>.</p>  
<p>

<h2>Dec. 10, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; UCSC Releases alignments of the chimp draft assembly to human genome</h2> 
<p> 
UCSC has released alignments of the Nov. 2003 chimpanzee draft assembly to the Jul. 2003 human 
assembly in the Genome Browser. These alignments may be viewed on the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=Human&db=hg16&position=chr4:56214201-56291736">Human Jul. 2003</a> 
assembly. This release coincides with today's <a href="http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/11509418" 
target="_blank">announcement</a> by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the 
first draft assembly of the chimpanzee genome.</p> 
<p> 
The set of human/chimpanzee alignments consists of a reciprocal best-in-genome net track and a 
chimp chain track. These alignments were generated using the blastz program developed at 
Pennsylvania State University and the programs blat, axtChain, chainNet, and netSyntenic developed 
at UCSC by Jim Kent. Research scientists should find these tracks useful for locating orthologous 
regions and studying genome rearrangement in the two species.</p> 
<p> 
For more information about the alignment tracks, refer to the track description pages. The tables 
may be downloaded from the Genome Browser FTP server's 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/database/">hg16 database directory</a>. The 
chimp sequence and alignment data are downloadable from the 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/vsPt0/">hg16 human/chimp alignments 
directory</a>.</p>  
<p> 
The chimp sequence used in these alignments was obtained from the Nov. 13, 2003 Arachne assembly. 
We'd like to thank NHGRI, the Eli & Edythe L. Broad Institute at MIT/Harvard, and Washington 
University School of Medicine for providing this sequence, and LaDeana Hillier, Washington 
University School of Medicine, and the Whitehead Institute for their work on the alignments. We'd 
also like to acknowledge the members of the UCSC team who contributed to the release of these 
alignments in the Genome Browser: Jim Kent, Kate Rosenbloom, Heather Trumbower, and Donna 
Karolchik.</p>

<h2>Nov. 24, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser released for mouse assembly NCBI Build 32</h2> 
<p> 
We have released a Genome Browser and Blat server for the latest mouse genome assembly, NCBI Build 
32 (UCSC v. mm4).  Build 32 is a composite assembly in which chromosomes were assembled by two 
slightly different algorithms depending on the available mapping data. Chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 
15, 18, 19, X, and Y were assembled using a clone-based tiling path file (TPF) provided by the Mouse
Genome Sequencing Consortium (MGSC), with whole genome shotgun sequence used to fill gaps when 
necessary. The remaining chromosomes were assembled using the MGSCv3 whole genome shotgun assembly 
as the TPF and merging High Throughput Genomic Sequence (HTGS) as needed. The UCSC mm4 assembly 
contains only the reference strain C57BL/6J.</p> 
<p> 
Build 32 includes 2.6 gigabases of sequence, 1.2 Gb of which is finished. We estimate that 90-96 
percent of the mouse genome is present in the assembly. For more information about this version, 
see the NCBI <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html" 
target="_blank">assembly notes</a> and

<p> 
The mm4 sequence and annotation data may be downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#mouse">downloads server</a>.</p>  
<p>
We'd like to thank the Deanna Church, Richa Agrawala, and the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium for
this assembly. We'd also like to acknowledge the work of the UCSC mm4 team: Hiram Clawson (lead), 
Terry Furey, Kate Rosenbloom, Heather Trumbower, Bob Kuhn and Donna Karolchik, and our systems 
administrators Patrick Gavin, Jorge Garcia and Paul Tatarsky.</p>

<h2>Oct. 31, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>D. melanogaster</em> assembly added to Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We have added the <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> (fruitfly) assembly to the growing collection of 
genomes available in the UCSC Genome Browser and Blat servers. Release 3.1 (Jan. 2003) of the 
<em>Drosophila</em> annotated genome sequence was provided by the 
<a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project</a> (BDGP). 
The 116.8 Mb euchromatic sequence - which is virtually gap-free and of high accuracy - contains six 
euchromatic chromosome arms represented by 13 scaffolds with a total of 37 sequence gaps. The 
sequence quality of this release has an estimated error rate of less than one in 100,000 base pairs 
in the unique portion of the sequence, and less than one in 10,000 base pairs in the repetitive 
portion. The Release 3.1 sequence was reannotated using the 
<a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/annot/apollo/" target="_blank">Apollo Genome Annotation and 
Curation Tool</a>. We also provide data comparing the genome of <em>D. melanogaster</em> with that 
of <em>D. pseudoobscura</em>.</p> 
<p> 
The fruitfly, one of the first organisms to be used in systematic scientific investigations, has 
been the subject of intensive study in genetics for nearly a century and remains a major model 
organism in biomedical research, population biology and evolution. We are pleased to add the 
fruitfly to the roster of assemblies available on our site.</p> 
<p>
Downloads of the <em>Drosophila</em> data and annotations may be obtained from the UCSC Genome 
Browser <a href ="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm1">ftp site</a>.</p>

<h2>Oct. 17, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; mRNA, RefSeq and EST data now updated incrementally for several 
assemblies</h2> 
<p> 
Daily and weekly incremental updates of mRNA, RefSeq, and EST data are now in place for several of 
the UCSC Genome Browser assemblies. Data sets that are updated incrementally from GenBank include 
the latest human (hg16), mouse (mm3), rat (rn3), and Fugu (fr1). Others will soon be added to the 
list.</p> 
<p> 
Previously, these tables were updated only when we loaded a new genome assembly into the Genome 
Browser or made a major revision to a table. By updating the data on a nightly basis, we are able to
provide researchers with the most current versions available in GenBank. All new genome assemblies 
released after this date will incorporate the incremental update technology.</p> 
<p> 
Data are updated on the following schedule:<br> 
- native and xeno mRNA and refSeq tracks - updated daily at 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time (weekdays), early
Saturday morning (weekends)<br> 
- EST data - updated once per week on Saturday morning<br> 
- downloadable data files - updated weekly on Sunday morning<br> 
- outdated sequences - removed once per quarter<br></p> 
<p> 
Mirror sites are not required to migrate to an incremental update process, and should not experience
problems as a result of this upgrade. Mirror site questions should be addressed to 
<a href="mailto:&#103;e&#110;&#111;m&#101;&#45;&#109;&#105;&#114;&#114;o&#114;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.&#101;&#100;&#117;">&#103;e&#110;&#111;m&#101;&#45;&#109;&#105;&#114;&#114;o&#114;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>.

<h2>Oct. 17, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; UCSC Table Browser enhancements</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC <a href="../cgi-bin/hgText">Table Browser</a> is an excellent tool for retrieving and 
searching the data underlying the Genome Browser. We've recently added some new features to the 
Table Browser to make it even easier to query and download data.</p> 
<p> 
Many of our users have requested a batch query utility that will allow them to paste in or upload a 
list of terms on which to search. You can now do this by clicking the &quot;Item
name/accession&quot; button, then uploading a list of search terms by selecting the
&quot;Paste in&quot; or &quot;Upload&quot; option. Note that the Paste option supports wildcards, 
but the Upload option does not.</p> 
<p> 
We've also added 2 new lists of searchable tables/tracks. The Browser tracks list contains the 
names of annotation tracks in the currently selected assembly as they appear in the Genome Browser. 
This list is useful if you don't know the name of the underlying database table that contains the 
data in which you're interested. The Custom tracks list contains the names of all custom annotation 
tables currently loaded into the Genome Browser for the given assembly. This includes tracks that 
have been created/loaded by the user as well as custom annotations created via the Table 
Browser.</p> 
<p> 
If you have feedback or questions about the Table Browser, please send us email at 
<a href="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;">&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;</a>.

<h2>Sep. 29, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Introducing the UCSC Gene Family Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We are pleased to announce the release of the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgNear" target="_blank">UCSC Gene 
Family Browser</a>. This major new addition to our website is a useful tool for collecting 
information on groups of genes that may be related in many different ways. The Browser provides 
information on gene expression, protein homology (both within and across species), GO terms, and 
Pfam domains, and cross links to many other databases.</p>  
<p> 
To access the Family Browser, click the link on the top menu on this page. The first time you use 
the Browser, the application will display a brief overview of the tool and information for starting 
and configuring it. To read a more detailed description of the Browser, see the Family Browser 
<a href="/goldenPath/help/hgNearHelp.html" target="_blank">User's Guide</a>.</p>  
<p> 
We are always interested in hearing feedback about the tools on our site. If you have comments or

<h2>Sep. 23, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Fugu genome added to Genome Browser</h2> 
<p>
We have added the <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> (Japanese pufferfish) assembly to the growing 
collection of genomes available in the UCSC Genome Browser and Blat servers. The Fugu v.3.0 (Aug. 
2002) whole genome shotgun assembly -- which is the fourth vertebrate assembly to be added to the 
UCSC Genome Browser -- was provided by the <a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/fugu6/fugu6.info.html"
target="_blank">US DOE Joint Genome Institute</a> (JGI) as part of the International Fugu Genome 
Consortium led by JGI and the <a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org" target="_blank">Singapore Institute 
of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB)</a>.</p>  
<p>
This assembly was constructed with the JGI assembler, JAZZ, from paired end sequencing reads 
produced by JGI and IMCB, at JGI, Myriad Genetics, and Celera Genomics, resulting in a sequence 
coverage of 5.7X. All reads are plasmid, cosmid, or BAC end sequences, with the predominant coverage
derived from 2 Kb insert plasmids. This assembly contains 20,379 scaffolds totaling 319 million 
base pairs. The largest 679 scaffolds total 160 million base pairs. The Fugu genome was annotated 
using the Ensembl system by the Fugu informatics group at IMCB.</p> 
<p>
The Fugu, which was one of the first vertebrate genomes to be draft-sequenced after human, serves 
an important role in the exploration of the human genome. In contrast to other vertebrates that have
been sequenced, the intergenic and intron regions of the Fugu are highly compressed and uncluttered 
with repetitive sequence, resulting in a genome that is unusually compact in size. The Fugu genome 
has proved useful in gene discovery and the identification and characterization of gene regulatory 
elements in other genomes.</p> 
<p>
Bulk downloads of the Fugu sequence and annotation data are available via FTP at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/fr1">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/fr1</a> 
or through the Downloads link on the Genome Browser home page. We recommend that FTP be used rather 
than HTML for the download of large or multiple files.</p> 
<p>
We'd like to thank JGI and the other members of the International Fugu Genome Consortium, including 
IMCB, the UK Human Genome Mapping Project (Hinxton), the Molecular Sciences Institute (Berkeley) and
the Institute for Systems Biology (Seattle), for providing the sequence, assembly, and analysis of 
this genome. We'd also like to acknowledge the members of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group who 
contributed to this release: Kate Rosenbloom (lead engineer), Heather Trumbower, Robert Kuhn, Donna 
Karolchik, and Jim Kent.</p>

<h2>Aug. 13, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; NISC Comparative Sequencing Program regions released in
Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group has released a browser and blat server on the first of more 
than 100 targeted genomic regions being sequenced in multiple species and analyzed by the NIH 
Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) Comparative Sequencing Program sponsored by NHGRI. This release 
coincides with the publication of the results of the study in the 14 Aug 2003 issue of 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v424/n6950/abs/nature01858_fs.html" 
target="_blank"><em>Nature</em></a> (Thomas, J.W. et. al. (2003) Comparative analyses of 
multi-species sequences from targeted genomic regions. <em>Nature</em> 424:788- 793). The browser 
displays sequence and annotations on a large region containing 10 previously identified genes - 
including the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis - in 13 vertebrate species. Organisms in the study 
include human, chimpanzee, baboon, cat, dog, cow, pig, rat, mouse, chicken, zebrafish and two 
species of pufferfish (Fugu and Tetraodon).</p>  
<p> 
The NISC Comparative Sequencing Program data may be accessed by clicking the Browser link on the 
Genome Browser home page and then selecting the "Zoo" option from the genome list.</p> 
<p> 
The research team, led by  NHGRI Scientific Director Eric D. Green, included scientists from 
Pennsylvania State University, University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), and the University of 
Washington in Seattle. In the study, the investigators systematically compared the patterns of 
transposon insertions among the species' sequences. One key result of the analysis was the 
confirmation of recently proposed mammalian evolutionary trees suggesting that primates are more 
closely related to rodents than to carnivores or artiodactyls. Another significant outcome was the 
discovery of a substantial number of previously unidentified non-coding DNA segments that are 
conserved across a wide range of species. Many of these regions could be identified only through 
comparisons of sequence from multiple species, demonstrating the importance of studying the genomes 
of a wide range of organisms as a means for identifying functional elements in the human genome.</p>
<p> 
UCSC built a customized version of the browser to display the target region for this study, allowing
scientists to interactively explore the data and predictions generated by this project, contribute 
data of their own, and track the project as data from additional species are generated. In addition 
to the browser, the UCSC team also contributed to the analytical portion of the study. Mathieu 
Blanchette identified the regions that are most highly conserved among species. Adam Siepel 
performed the phylogenetic analysis of rates of substitution. The UCSC team worked with Arian Smit 
to obtain definitive evidence that rodents branched off from the common ancestor later than 
carnivores and artiodactyls.</p>

comparative analysis for this Genome Browser release. Special thanks go to Elliott Margulies at 
NHGRI for serving as the main liaison between NHGRI and UCSC, and for contributing several 
annotation tracks to the browser. We'd also like to acknowledge the efforts of the many faculty, 
grad students, and staff members of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group who contributed to the 
research effort and browser development for this project.</p>

<h2>Aug. 8, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; New human genome reference sequence now available in Genome
Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The latest human genome reference sequence (NCBI Build 34, Jul. 2003) is now available as database 
hg16 in the UCSC Genome Browser and blat server.</p> 
<p> 
There are 2,843,433,602 finished sequenced bases in the ordered and oriented portion of the 
assembly, which is an increase of 0.4 percent, or approximately 11 Mb, over the Build 33 assembly. 
Of particular note in this release is the addition of the pseudoautosomal regions of the Y 
chromosome. This sequence was taken from the corresponding regions in the X chromosome and is an 
exact duplication of that sequence.</p>  
<p> 
Some sequence joins between adjacent clones in this assembly could not be computationally validated 
because the clones originated from different haplotypes and contained polymorphisms in the 
overlapping sequence, or the overlap was too small to be to be reliable.  In these instances, the 
sequencing center responsible for the particular chromosome has provided data to support the join 
in the form of an electronic certificate. The Build 34 certificates may be reviewed 
<a href="certificates/certificate_hg16.html">here</a>.</p> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the data are available via FTP at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16</a> 
or through the <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">Downloads</a> link. We 
recommend that FTP be used rather than HTML for the download of large or multiple files.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank NCBI and the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium for furnishing the 
data, and the UCSC team members who contributed to this release: Terry Furey, Hiram Clawson, 
Heather Trumbower, Mark Diekhans, Robert Baertsch, Donna Karolchik, Jim Kent and our sysadmin team 
Patrick Gavin, Jorge Garcia, and Paul Tatarsky.</p>

<h2>Jul. 14, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Rat genome v.3.1 added to Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a browser and BLAT server on the v. 3.1 rat genome
assembly from the Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium. This assembly (UCSC version rn3, June 2003) was 
produced by the Atlas group at <a href="http://hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/rat/"
target="_blank">Baylor Human Genome Sequencing Center</a> (HGSC). This assembly is a minor update to
the 3.0 release. Sequence changes affect only chromosomes 7 and X. No additional assembly releases 
are planned prior to the publication of the rat genome analysis papers.</p> 
<p> 
The 3.x assemblies reflect several sequence additions and software improvements over the previous 
2.x assemblies, including the sequencing of over 1100 new BACs to cover gaps, an improved marker set
from the Medical College of Wisconsin, a new FPC map from the BC Genome Sciences Centre, and 
improved linking of bactigs. For detailed information and statistics about the 3.x assemblies, see 
the Baylor HGSC <a href="ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/analysis/rat/README" 
target="_blank">README</a>.</p> 
<p> 
Downloads of the rat sequence and annotation data are available at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rnJun2003/" 
target="_blank"> ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rnJun2003/</a> or via the Downloads link 
on this page. These data are made available with <a href="credits.html#rat_use">specific conditions 
for use</a>.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank the Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium and Baylor HGSC for providing this assembly,
collaborators from other institutions who have contributed annotations, and Arian Smit for updating 
RepeatMasker for this release.  We'd also like to acknowledge the contributions of several 
individuals at UCSC, including Hiram Clawson, Heather Trumbower, Robert Kuhn, Yontao Lu, Terry 
Furey, Mark Diekhans, Robert Baertsch, Donna Karolchik, Jim Kent, and our sysadmin team Jorge 
Garcia, Patrick Gavin, and Paul Tatarsky.</p>

<h2>Jun. 24, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browsers released for <em>C. elegans</em> and <em>C.
briggsae</em></h2> 
<p> 
UCSC has just released browsers and blat servers for 2 worms: C. elegans version WS100 (May 2003) 
and C. briggsae version cb25.agp8 (Jul. 2002). The browsers are based on sequence obtained from 
<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/" target="_blank">WormBase</a>.</p>  
<p> 
We are pleased to add the nematodes to the roster of genomes available on our site. C. elegans is a 
major model organism used for biomedical research, and is the first multicellular animal to have a 
fully sequenced genome. In contrast,  the whole genome shotgun assembly of the C. briggsae genome is
estimated to have achieved 98% coverage. Draft chromosome sequences are not available for C. 
briggsae, due to the lack of dense chromosomal maps that allow assignment of ultracontigs to 
chromosomal locations. As a result, all data in the C. briggsae browser maps to chrUn.</p>  
<p> 
Both worms played a significant role in the early history of the UCSC Genome Browser. The browser 
code originated with a C script that displayed a splicing diagram for a gene prediction from C. 
elegans. Tracks for mRNA alignments and for homology with C. briggsae were added, and the tool 
morphed into the precursor of the Genome Browser, the &quot;Intronerator&quot; (Kent, WJ and Zahler,
AM (2000). 
<a href="http://nar.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/1/91?ijkey=155fc1582751ebf7b01072beb40325b1d0682fdc&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" 
target="_blank">The intronerator: Exploring introns and alternative splicing in C. elegans</a>. 
<em>Nucleic Acids Res.</em> 28: 91-93).</p>  
<p>

<p> 
We'd like to thank the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Genome Sequencing Center 
at Washington University in St. Louis</a> and the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" 
target="_blank">Sanger Institute</a> for their collaborative work in sequencing the C. elegans and 
C.  briggsae genomes. Many thanks to the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/about/staff" 
target="_blank">WormBase consortium</a> for making the worm sequence publicly available. We'd also 
like to acknowledge several UCSC people who contributed to this release: Hiram Clawson (browser and 
annotation tracks engineering), Jim Kent (WABA and chaining/netting), Al Zahler (WABA), Heather 
Trumbower (QA and project management), and Donna Karolchik (project management and
documentation).</p>

<h2>Jun. 23, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Genome Browser UI changes</h2> 
<p> 
You may notice that we've removed the Genome pulldown menu and genome assembly information from our 
home page. Genome-specific information and links, as well as genome selection, are now available on 
the gateway pages for our tools. To open up a gateway page, simply click the Browser, Blat, or 
Tables link in the left sidebar.</p>

<h2>May 23, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; SARS Coronavirus TOR2 draft assembly available</h2> 
<p> 
[NOTE: The SARS assembly is no longer available on our public site, but may be accessed on our test 
server, <a href="http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu">genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu</a>.]</p> 
<p> 
Today we'd like to announce the release of a genome browser and BLAT server for the SARS coronavirus
TOR2 draft assembly. The browser - which is based on sequence deposited into GenBank as of Apr. 14, 
2003 - provides seven annotations showing gene predictions, locations of putative proteins, and 
viral mRNA and protein alignments. Of particular note are the protein structure analysis and 
predictions, determined by using the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html" 
target="_blank">Sequence Alignment and Modeling (SAM) T02</a> tool. </p> 
<p> 
This browser marks a departure from our usual collection of vertebrate genomes. Its inception was 
inspired by one of our engineers - Angie Hinrichs - who was vacationing in New Zealand when the SARs
draft assembly was initially released. Struck by the impact of SARS in that part of the world, she 
downloaded the sequence and built the initial tracks from a terminal at an Internet cafe! The rest 
of the team joined in on the grassroots effort, generating the additional annotations and SAM T02 
protein analyses and predictions. Victor Solovyev chimed in with Fgenesv+ gene predictions from 
Softberry Inc. UCSC does not intend to provide a comprehensive collection of viral genomes in the 
future, but will maintain this browser as long as scientific and public interest in SARS 
persists.</p> 
<p> 
Downloads of the annotation data are available at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/scApr2003/database" 
target="_blank">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/scApr2003/database</a> or via the Downloads
link on this page.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank everyone who worked on this release, including Angie Hinrichs, Robert Baertsch, 
Fan Hsu, Matt Schwartz, Heather Trumbower, Jim Kent, Kevin Karplus, Donna Karolchik, Brian Raney, 
Hiram Clawson, Kate Rosenbloom, Victor Solovyev, and our extremely dedicated systems administrators 
Paul Tatarsky, Patrick Gavin, and Jorge Garcia.</p>

<h2>Apr. 21, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Chromosome 8 data corrected for April 2003 human assembly</h2> 
<p> 
The file that we originally used to build the agp files for the Apr. 2003 human release (Build 33) 
erroneously contained 2 contigs on chromosome 8 that were listed twice: NT_078037, NT_008183. We've 
received a corrected version and have updated the following files on our website: contigAgp.zip, 
chromAgp.zip, liftAll.zip. You can obtain the newer versions of these files from our ftp site at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/10april2003/bigZips/"> 
ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/10april2003/bigZips/</a>.</p>

<h2>Apr. 14, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Human Genome Project successfully completed!</h2> 
<p> 
The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium today announced the successful completion of 
the Human Genome Project. The most significant outcome of this project is the reference sequence of 
the human genome. The sequencing of the 3 billion letters of DNA in the human genome - which many 
consider to be one of the most ambitious scientific undertakings in history - was completed 2 years 
ahead of schedule and at substantially less cost than original estimates. The reference sequence 
will serve as a new foundation for research in the fields of medicine and human biology.</p>  
<p> 
In conjunction with this announcement, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group is proud to release a 
genome browser and BLAT server on the reference sequence (NCBI Build 33), along with bulk downloads 
of the sequence and annotation data. The initial browser provides a preliminary set of annotations 
that will be expanded in coming weeks. Bulk downloads of the data are available via FTP at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/10april2003">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/10april2003</a> 
or through the <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">Downloads</a> link on this 
page. We recommend that FTP be used rather than HTML for the download of large or multiple
files.</p> 
<p> 
The reference sequence covers about 99 percent of the human genome's gene-containing regions, and 
has been sequenced to an accuracy of 99.99 percent. The missing portions are essentially contained 
in less than 400 defined gaps that represent DNA regions with unusual structures that can't be 
reliably sequenced using current technology. The average DNA letter now lies within a stretch of 
approximately 27,332,000 base pairs of uninterrupted sequence!</p> 
<p> 
Chromosomal sequences for this release were assembled by the International Human Genome Sequencing 
Consortium sequencing centers and verified by NCBI and UCSC. In some cases, sequence joins between 
adjacent clones could not be computationally validated, e.g. due to polymorphisms in the overlapping
sequence. In situations like this, supporting evidence for the join has been provided by the 
sequencing center responsible for that particular chromosome. The <a href="certificate.html">Non-standard Join Certificates</a> table displays this information. The annotations on the UCSC website 
have been provided by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. See the <a href="credits.html">Credits</a> 
page for a detailed list of organizations and individuals who contributed to this release.</p> 
<p>
We'd like to congratulate the many people worldwide who have worked on the Human Genome Project for 
this landmark achievement. We'd also like to acknowledge the UCSC Genome Browser project team who 
worked many long hours to ensure that the genome browser and sequence data were released on time for
this announcement: David Haussler, Jim Kent, Terry Furey, Matt Schwartz, Heather Trumbower, Angie 
Hinrichs, Fan Hsu, Donna Karolchik, Jorge Garcia, Patrick Gavin, Chuck Sugnet, Yontao Lu, Mark 
Diekhans, Ryan Weber, Robert Baertsch, Krishna Roskin, and the many other students in the UCSC 
Genome Bioinformatics group.</p>

<h2>Apr. 2, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Human assembly hg10 and mouse assembly mm1 archived</h2> 
<p> 
The Dec. 2001 Human assembly (hg10) and the Nov. 2001 Mouse assembly (mm1) have been moved to the 
archives. They are no longer viewable in the main browser, but can still be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.edu">downloads server</a>.</p>

<h2>Mar. 26, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; New rat assembly released in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We've added an updated rat assembly to our site: Rat Jan 2003 (rn2). This corresponds to the 
Version 2.1 Jan 2003 Update of the rat genome assembly, produced by the Atlas group at Baylor HGSC 
as part of the Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium.</p> 
<p> 
This update corrects duplications that were assembly artifacts in the previous version and improves 
the linking of bactigs to create larger "ultrabactigs". Compared with the previous rat assembly, 
sequence mapped to specific chromosomal coordinates is reduced by about 1.6 percent. Loosely mapped 
and unmapped sequence is reduced by 17 percent. For more details and statistics on the Jan. 2003 
assembly, see the Baylor HGSC 
<a href="ftp://rat-ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/analysis/rat/README">README</a> for this release.</p>  
<p> 
UCSC has released a Genome Browser and BLAT server for this assembly update. The initial 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=rn2"> browser</a> contains 16 annotation tracks, with more to follow
in coming weeks. Sequence downloads are currently available at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rnJan2003/" 
target="_blank">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rnJan2003/</a> or via the Downloads link on
this page. A complete set of database downloads will be available at the beginning of next week. 
This data contains <a href="credits.html#rat_use">specific conditions for use</a>.</p> 
<p> 
Thanks to the Atlas group at Baylor HGSC, the Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium, the UCSC Genome 
Bioinformatics group, and contributors worldwide for making this release available.</p>

<h2>Mar. 13, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp; Updated mouse genome assembly now available</h2> 
<p> 
We're happy to announce an update to the mouse genome sequence. This new version (Mouse Feb.  2003) 
includes 705 megabases of finished sequence, compared to 96 megabases of finished sequence in the 
previous assembly. Many people in the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium contributed to this update.
The Sanger Institute in particular contributed a large amount of finished sequence. Richa Agarwala, 
Deanna Church, and coworkers at NCBI layered the finished clones on top of the Arachne whole genome 
shotgun assembly. Arian Smit constructed a new RepeatMasker library.</p>  
<p> 
UCSC has released a Genome Browser and BLAT server for the Feb. 2003 Mouse genome. The initial 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=mm3"> browser</a> contains 14 annotation tracks, with more to follow
in coming weeks. Sequence downloads are currently available at 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mmFeb2003/" 
target="_blank">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mmFeb2003/</a> or via the Downloads link on
this page. Database downloads will be available at the beginning of next week.</p> 
<p> 
Thanks to everybody at UCSC and around the world that contributed to this release!</p> 

<h2>Feb. 5, 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Enhanced version of Genome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
We're proud to announce the release of version 17 of the UCSC Genome Browser. This version contains 
powerful new features, numerous improvements to the annotation track display, additional annotation 
tracks, and a number of bug fixes. In this release cycle, we've also introduced an enhanced QA 
process that formalizes our testing and verification of the Genome Browser software and the data 
displayed in the browser.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>New functionality in v.17:</strong><br> 
-- Numerous enhancements to the table browser that allow the user to conduct more complex and 
specific searches. New features include support for intersections of tracks, a new summary 
statistics output format, and the ability to output query results as a custom annotation track that 
can be viewed in the Genome Browser. The new <a href="help/hgTextHelp.html" target="_blank">Table 
Browser User's Guide</a> contains a detailed description of the new features and provides a wealth 
of information and examples for conducting various types of searches on the database tables.</p> 
<p>
-- Two new display modes available for most annotation tracks: pack and squish modes. In <em>pack 
mode</em> display, annotation track features are fully displayed, but more than one feature may be 
displayed on the same line. This greatly reduces the amount of display space needed by a track when 
a user wishes to view a large number of individual features at one time. <em>Squish mode</em> is 
similar to pack mode, but displays features at 50% height and without labels. This mode is 
particularly useful for viewing tracks in which a large number of features align to the same section
of a chromosome, e.g. EST tracks.</p>  
<p> 
-- Functional groupings of annotation track controls. This makes it much easier to find a particular
item in the track control list and gives a better visual overview of the annotations available in a 
particular category, e.g. comparative genomics tracks or gene prediction tracks.</p> 
<p> 
-- A mechanism for saving the annotation tracks image in postscript or PDF format. This much 
requested feature enables Genome Browser users to print an image at high resolution, edit it with a 
drawing program, or display it in a postscript or PDF viewer.</p> 
<p> 
-- A <a href="help/customTrack.html" target="_blank">collection of custom annotation tracks</a> 
supplied by Genome Browser users and members of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics lab. Additional 
contributions to this collection are welcome! Contact 
<a href="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;">&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;</a> 
<!-- above address is genome at soe.ucsc.edu --> 
if you have an annotation you'd like to share.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>New annotation tracks in v.17:</strong><br> 
-- a new Known Genes track (Human Builds 30 & 31, Feb 2002 Mouse, Nov 2002 Rat) that shows known 
protein-coding genes based on proteins from SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and TrEMBL-NEW and their 
corresponding mRNAs from GenBank. Features within the track are color-coded according to origin and 
review status.</p> 
<p>
-- a new Superfamily track (Human Build 30, Feb 2002 Mouse) that shows proteins having homologs with
known structures or functions. Each entry in the track shows the coding region of a gene (based on 
Ensembl gene prediction). The feature label consists of the names of all known protein domains coded
by the gene, and usually contains structural and/or function descriptions that provide valuable 
information for getting a quick grasp of the biological significance for the gene.</p> 
<p> 
We have also released several additional annotation tracks on the latest human and rat assemblies in
the past month.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Bug fixes in v.17:</strong><br> 
-- Approximately 40 bugs (mostly minor problems) have been fixed in this version.</p> 
<p> 
To take full advantage of the new display features in this release, we recommend that you reset your
browser to the new default settings. NOTE: you may not want to reset your browser if you have 
customized settings that you wish to preserve. You can reset your browser by clicking the
&quot;Click here to reset&quot; link on the Browser Gateway page.</p>  
<p> 
We hope this new release facilitates your work with the UCSC Genome Browser. If you have any 
questions or comments about the new release, send email to 
<a href="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;">&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;</a>.

<h2>Dec. 23, 2002  &nbsp;&nbsp; Human Genome assembly Build 31 released in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We're pleased to announce the release of the latest human genome assembly, Build 31 (UCSC version 
hg13). This assembly was produced at NCBI based on sequence information submitted into GenBank as of
Nov. 14, 2002.  Release notes for this assembly are available from the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/release_notes.html" target="_blank">NCBI web
site</a>. Because UCSC now obtains its assembly directly from NCBI, the UCSC Build 31 data is 
identical to that of NCBI and Ensembl.</p>  
<p> 
Build 31 is an excellent high-quality assembly that shows a remarkable amount of progress toward the
milestone of finishing the human genome. Greater than 95% of the euchromatic region of the genome 
is now complete, with more than 90% of the sequence in a finished state. The number of clone contig 
gaps has decreased by one third from the previous assembly, and the overall number of sequenced 
contigs has been reduced by one half. Seven chromosomes are considered to be in a finished state: 6,
7, 13, 20, 21, 22, and Y.</p>  
<p> 
The initial release of the Build 31 Genome Browser contains 25 annotation tracks, with several more 
to follow in the upcoming weeks. Bulk downloads of the data are available from our FTP site at

<h2>Dec. 6, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Rat Genome assembly now available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We're pleased to announce the release of a UCSC Genome Browser on the Nov. 2002 rat assembly 
produced by the Baylor College of Medicine Rat Genome Sequencing Center and the Rat Genome 
Sequencing Consortium. The sequence was assembled using a hybrid approach that combines the clone by
clone and whole genome shotgun methods. A new software program - ATLAS - was developed for this 
effort. The assembly process resulted in a 6.5-fold coverage of the rat genome, which is estimated 
to be approximately 2.8 Gigabases in size.</p> 
<p> 
Downloads of the rat data and annotations are available through our 
ftp site at <a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rn1" target="_blank">downloads 
server</a>. This data contains <a href="credits.html#rat_use">specific conditions for use</a>. The 
sequence is also available from the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/rat" 
target="_blank">Rat Genome Project website</a> for the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor 
College of Medicine or from GenBank.</p> 
<p> 
We'd like to thank the Baylor team and the Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium for their collaboration 
on this project. See the <a href="credits.html#rat_credits">Credits page</a> for a complete list of 
acknowledgments. For more information on the rat genome, the assembly process, and the Rat Genome 
Sequencing Consortium, refer to the website for the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/"

<h2>Dec. 5, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mouse Genome Browser released</h2> 
<p> 
The International Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium has announced the publication of a high-quality
draft sequence of the mouse genome, together with a comparative analysis of the mouse and human 
genomes. The results from this analysis can be found in the Mouse Genome Browser on this website. 
The paper appears in the Dec. 5 issue of the journal Nature at 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/mousegenome/" 
target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/mousegenome/</a>. The co-author list includes several 
members of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group: CBSE Director David Haussler, Research Scientist 
Jim Kent and research team members Robert Baertsch, Mark Diekhans, Terrence Furey, Angie Hinrichs, 
Fan Hsu, Donna Karolchik, Krishna Roskin, Matt Schwartz, Charles Sugnet and Ryan Weber.</p>

<h2>Oct. 29, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional data downloads available for human assembly Jun. 2002</h2>
<p> 
We've added several new directories of downloadable data to the Jun. 28, 2002 human genome assembly.
These directories contain mouse/human alignments of the Jun. 2002 human assembly vs. the Feb. 2002 
mouse assembly. You can access these directories from our 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg12/" target="_blank">downloads server</a>.</p> 
<p>
Within the main directory <em>vsMm2</em> are 3 subdirectories that contain all the alignments 
(<em>axtAll</em>), alignments filtered to provide only the best alignment for any given region of 
the human genome (<em>axtBest</em>), and a relatively stringent subset of the axtBest alignments 
(<em>axtTight</em>). For more information about the format of the alignment files and the methods 
used to generate the alignments, consult the <em>README.txt</em> file in the vsMm2 directory. </p>

<h2>Oct. 18, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancements in v16 Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We've rolled out a new version of the Genome Browser - v.16. In addition to several bug fixes, this 
release contains some interesting new features.</p> 
<p> 
The Table Browser has undergone major enhancements. Users can now restrict their queries by 
specifying a value or range for any of the fields in a table, and by selecting which fields should 
be displayed in the output. The Table Browser also provides the ability to do a free-form SQL query 
on a table and supports several new output formats.</p>  
<p>	
We've extended the capabilities of the DNA retrieval functionality in the Genome Browser and the 
Table Browser. The new mechanism offers the user several options for configuring the amount and 
type of sequence region that is retrieved, and options for formatting the sequence output. The 
retrieval options vary based on the type of table selected.</p> 
<p>	
The Genome Browser's gene prediction tracks now offer a Comparative Sequence link in addition to the
predicted protein, mRNA sequence, and genomic sequence links. The Comparative Sequence feature 
displays annotated codons and translated protein for the region in alignment to another species.</p>
<p>	
A logarithmic scale and displays in the track as &quot;mountain ranges&quot; Details pages 
associated with the individual peaks in the track provide access to the base level alignments for 
the whole region and for the individual 50bp windows.</p> 
<p>
The team that produced this track includes Ryan Weber, Krishna Roskin, Mark Diekhans, Jim Kent, 
Scott Schwartz, and Webb Miller.</p>

<h2>Sep. 12, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; User's Guide to the Human Genome&quot; features UCSC

<h2>Sep. 12, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Correction to Human Assembly hg12 Chromosome Bands annotation</h2> 
<p> 
We've corrected a problem with the Human Jun. 2002 (hg12) cytoBand annotation track that affected 
chromosome Y. The clones on this chromosome were erroneously pushed from the q-arm onto the p-arm, 
creating some confusion. The currently available version of the cytoBand data on this website 
contains this correction.</p>

<h2>Aug. 15, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional annotations for human draft assembly hg12 released</h2> 
<p> 
We've just released several new annotation tracks/tables for the human genome. On the Jun. 2002 
assembly, we've added Gene Bounds, UniGene, CpG Islands, Nonhuman mRNA & EST, SNPs, NC160, and GNF 
Ratio. On the Apr. 2002 assembly we've added a Fgenesh++ Genes track, and have also updated the 
RepeatMasker track. The Dec. 2001 release now includes a Sanger 22 track.</p> 
<p>
On the mouse genome, we have 2 new tracks for the Feb. 2002 assembly: TIGR Gene Index and
RNA Genes.</p>
	
<h2>Aug. 6, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Error with six chromosome 3 contigs in human assembly hg12</h2> 
<p> 
We have fixed an error with six of the chr3 contigs in the bigZips/contigAgp.zip file. The following
.agp files were corrected: NT_005684.agp, NT_005663.agp, NT_022554.agp, NT_022459.agp, 
NT_006031.agp, and NT_022419.agp. The chr3.agp file in bigZips/chromAgp.zip was also modified. This 
change does not affect the .gl files, the .fa files, the lift files, or the annotations. Alignments 
made on the previous version of chr3 are still good. Updated versions of the contigAgp.zip and 
chromAgp.zip files were uploaded to our site today. You can download the new versions via ftp from 
our <a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg12" target="_blank">downloads 
server</a>.</p>

<h2>Aug. 2, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; New RepeatMasker track available for human assembly hg12</h2> 
<p>
The problems with the Jun. 2002 Build 30 (hg12) RepeatMasker track have been resolved. The new 
RepeatMasker track, along with regenerated Fish Blat and Genscan tracks, are now available in the 
Browser and through our Downloads link. We've also added a few new annotation tracks for the Jun. 
2002 release, and will be adding more over the next 2 weeks.</p> 
<p>
The latest Genome Browser has 2 new features. We've added filter functionality to the Table Browser,
accessible via the Filter Fields button on the Table Browser main page. Also, some of the Dec. 2001 
human genome tracks (eg. RefSeq Genes) now have a Comparative Sequence link from the details page 
that shows annotated codons and translated protein with alignment to the mouse genome.</p>

<h2>Jul. 27, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Problems with repeat-masking on human assembly hg12</h2> 
<p> 
We've experienced some RepeatMasker problems on Build 30 and are rerunning it. This will directly 
affect the RepeatMasker track and the masking of the fasta files. The Fish Blat and Genscan tracks 
may also change slightly once we're redone this. The EST, mRNA, and RefSeq tracks should not be 
affected. We will also post a new RepeatMasker track for Build 29 (see news item below) as soon as 
the Build 30 tracks are completed. We apologize for any rework this may cause.</p>

<h2>Jul. 26, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Bulk data downloads now available for human assembly hg12</h2> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the Jun. 2002 Build 30 human genome assembly (hg12) are now available from the 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg12/" target="_blank">downloads server</a>. This 
initial release of the annotation database download contains a limited set of tables. Additional 
files will be available for download next week.</p>

<h2>Jul. 24, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Human assembly hg12 blat server available</h2> 
<p> 
The BLAT server and the coordinates conversion feature for human genome assembly Build 30 (hg12) are
now functional.</p>

<h2>Jul. 23, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-release of human draft assembly Build 30 in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p>
We're pleased to announce the pre-release of a browser for human genome assembly Build 30 from NCBI 
(UCSC version hg12). This assembly was produced at NCBI based on sequence information submitted into
GenBank as of Jun. 28, 2002. Build 30 release notes and statistics will soon be available from the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/" target="_blank">NCBI web site</a>.</p>  
<p> 
Build 30 is an excellent high-quality assembly. It contains nearly 87% finished sequence, and 
94%-97% coverage. The sequence coverage of this build is much higher than in previous releases, and 
there is a high level of correspondence between the sequence and the map. Currently, the human 
genome project appears to be on track to achieve the goal of finishing at least 95% of the human 
genome (using Bermuda standards) by Apr. 2003.</p>  
<p> 
UCSC has generated a set of high-level comparisons of the Build 30 draft sequence against various 
types of information (STS maps, BAC end pairs, and clone overlaps), accessible from the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/human/chromReports/24Jun2002/" 
target="_blank">Chromosome Reports</a> and 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/human/mapPlots/" target="_blank">Genome Map 
Plots</a> links in the &quot;Technical Information about the Assembled Sequence&quot; section 
below.</p> 
<p> 
A Blat server for Build 30 is not yet available, but should be accessible from this site later this 
week. Data for the mitochondrial genome and several more annotation tracks will be posted for this 
release as they become available. Bulk downloads of the hg12 data should be available from this site
in a few days.</p>

<h2>Jul. 9, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat-masking problems on human assembly hg11</h2> 
<p>
We've found some problems with the repeat-masking of the Build 29 (hg11) human sequence. We're in 
the process of replacing the RepeatMasker track, but do not plan to redo the other tracks due to the
imminent release of Build 30. Because of this, we advise that you do not use the cross-species 
tracks for statistical purposes.</p>

<h2>Jul. 1, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; New look for UCSC Genome Bioinformatics home page</h2> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics home page is sporting an updated interface to accommodate the 
growing number of organisms supported by the UCSC Genome Browser, BLAT, and Table Browser. The list 
of assembly versions accessible through each of these tools can now be found on the tool's Gateway 
page. To reach the Gateway page, choose an organism from the dropdown list on the left sidebar of 
this page, then click the Browser, BLAT, or Tables link. New organisms will be added to the list in 
the months ahead.</p>  
<p>
The UCSC site continues to provide a variety of bulk downloads of a genome assemblies and 
annotations. The list of downloadable data has been removed from the home page, but is readily 
available through the Downloads link on the left sidebar. The downloads list can also be accessed 
directly at 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html</a> 
or through our ftp site at <a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/" 
target="_blank">ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/</a>.</p>  
<p>
Several new annotation tracks have been added to our site in the past couple weeks. The Feb. 2002 
mouse assembly now has tracks for BAC End pairs, Fgenesh++ gene predictions, and AltGenie gene 
predictions based on Affymetrix's Genie gene-finding software. New to the Apr. 2002 human assembly 
is the GenMapDB Clones track, which shows placements of BAC clones from the GenMapDB database based 
on BAC end sequencing information and confirmed using STS markers by Vivian Cheung's lab at U. Penn.
We've also changed the Known Genes track name to RefSeq Genes in all assemblies.</p>  
<p>
This release also includes an updated <a href="help/hgTracksHelp.html" target="_blank">User's 
Guide</a> and more detailed documentation on creating & using <a href="help/customTrack.html" 
target="_blank">custom annotation tracks</a>.</p>

<h2>May 24, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Bulk data downloads for human assembly hg11 now available</h2> 
<p> 
Bulk downloads of the April 2002 hg11 human genome assembly (NCBI Build 29) are now available from 
the <a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg11/" target="_blank">downloads
server</a>.</p>

<h2>May 22, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Human draft assembly Build 29 released in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p> 
We've just released a browser and BLAT server on the latest Build 29 human genome assembly from NCBI
(UCSC version hg11). This assembly is based on sequence information submitted into GenBank as of 
Apr. 5 2002. As with the Dec. 2001 (hg10) release, this assembly was produced at NCBI rather than at
UCSC. Consult NCBI's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/release_notes.html" 
target="_blank">Build 29 release notes</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/HsStats.html" target="_blank">statistics</a>
for more information about this release. This assembly contains nearly 75% finished sequence. 
Currently, the human genome project appears to be on track to achieve the goal of finishing at least
95% of the human genome (using Bermuda standards) by Apr. 2003.</p> 
<p>
Although the NCBI human genome assembly has been steadily improving over the past year, mapping 
problems still exist in the current release. Most are small, relatively local rearrangements. Larger
scale problems include a rearrangement in the p-arm of Chr16 and several discrepancies in Chr17. 
Researchers - especially positional cloners - are strongly encouraged to use the tools provided 
(<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/human/mapPlots/" target="_blank">comparison 
plots</a>, <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/human/chromReports/" 
target="_blank">chromosome reports</a>) to evaluate the accuracy of the assembly in specific regions
of interest.</p> 
<p>
Bulk downloads of the hg11 data should be available from this site in approximately one week. New 
annotation tracks will be posted as soon as they become available.</p>

<h2>Apr. 24, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Bulk data downloads of mouse assembly Feb. 2002 available</h2> 
<p>
Bulk downloads of the February 2002 mouse genome assembly are now available from the 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm2/" target="_blank">downloads server</a>.</p>

<h2>Apr. 19, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; New mouse genome assembly released</h2> 
<p>
The Feb. 2002 mouse genome assembly is now available in the browser and for BLAT searching. This 
assembly was produced at the Whitehead Institute using their Arachne software. We'd like to thank 
them and the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium for providing this assembly, which has 
<a href="credits.html#mouserestrict">specific conditions for use</a>. Bulk downloads of the data 
should be available in approximately one week. Coordination with mouse genome data access at 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/">Ensembl</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/">NCBI</a> is in progress. We'd also like to
acknowledge the UCSC team that produced this release: Jim Kent, Terry Furey, Matt Schwartz, Fan Hsu,
Yontao Lu, Donna Karolchik, Chuck Sugnet, and Ryan Weber.</p>

<h2>Apr. 9, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Bulk data downloads of mouse assembly Nov. 2001 available</h2> 
<p>
Bulk downloads of the November 2001 mouse genome assembly are now available from the 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm1/" target="_blank">downloads server</a>.</p>

<h2>Apr. 2, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Release of new Genome Browser version and mouse/human annotations</h2>
<p>
An updated version of the UCSC Genome Browser (v.11) is now available. Along with the v.11 browser, 
we've released several new annotation tracks on the latest human and mouse assemblies. The new Human
Dec. 2001 tracks include: Mouse Synteny, Ensembl, Genscan, CpG Islands, Mouse Blat, Fish Blat, 
Unigene/SAGE, NCI60 Microarray, GNF Affymetrix Microarray, Rosetta Microarray, and SNPs. An STS 
Markers track has been added to the Mouse Nov. 2001 browser.</p>

<h2> Mar. 14, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mouse draft assembly Nov. 2001 released in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p>
The November 2001 mouse genome assembly is now available for viewing in the browser and for BLAT 
searching. This assembly was produced at the Sanger Center using the Phusion software developed by 
Jim Mullikin and Zemin Ning, and was tied to the mouse fingerprint map by Tim Hubbard. We'd like to 
thank them and the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium for providing this assembly, which has 
<a href="credits.html#mouserestrict">specific conditions for use</a>. Bulk downloads of the data 
will be available in approximately one week. Coordination with mouse genome data access at 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/">Ensembl</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/">NCBI</a> is in progress. We'd also like to
acknowledge the UCSC team that produced this release: Jim Kent, Terry Furey, Matt Schwartz, Fan Hsu,
Yontao Lu, and Donna Karolchik.</p>

<h2>Feb. 16, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Human Genome assembly Build 28 now available</h2> 
<p>
A new assembly based on sequence submitted as of Dec. 22 in GenBank (Build 28) is now available in 
the browser and for BLAT search. This assembly was produced at NCBI rather than UCSC, primarily by 
Richa Agarwala, Greg Schuler, and Paul Kitts. The NCBI assembly has been steadily improving over the
past year. Currently it shows slightly better local order and orientation compared to the UCSC 
assembly on the same sequence, but somewhat worse tracking of the chromosome level maps. The NCBI 
assembly has the advantage that it can be generated significantly faster than the UCSC assembly. 
With the human genome sequencing now in the end game - over two thirds of the human clones are now 
finished - we feel it more productive to focus worldwide annotation efforts on a single assembly 
rather than continue producing competing assemblies. We're working with NCBI to improve their map 
tracking.</p> 

<h2>Feb. 4, 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp; Chromosome Reports released</h2> 
<p>
Chromosome Reports detailing correspondence with STS map, overlap, and BAC end sequence information 
are available under the &quot;Technical Information About the Assembled Sequence&quot; section 
below. This also gives information about the clone map on which the assembled sequence is based.</p>

<a name="2001"></a>
<h2>Dec. 18, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Genome Browser enhancements</h2> 
<p>
There are some major enhancements to the browser. The complete user interface settings including 
track controls, labels, and position are now saved from session to session. You can configure the 
browser once to your liking and it will stay that way. This feature will only work if cookies are 
enabled in your browser. If you want to restore the default settings use the reset all button under 
the main graphic. Also under the main graphic are new controls that move just the start or just the 
end of the genome window. These are useful for getting exactly the right view without having to do 
arithmetic on the position. These controls by default will move two guideline units at a time, but 
you can specify other increments.  There's a new page associated with each track. This page is 
accessible by clicking on the mini-buttons to the left of the track in the main graphic, or by 
clicking on the new hyperlink associated with the track in the track controls section under the 
graphic. These pages contain a description of the track and in many cases new controls. The mRNA and
EST associated controls let you color or filter the display according to tissue, author, organism, 
and so forth.</p> 
<p>
As with any new enhancement there are likely to be a few new bugs too. Many of these have been 
spotted and fixed already. Please let us know if you find a problem that persists more than a day 
or two. It's always helpful to include the freeze and genomic position with a problem report.</p>

<h2>Nov. 39, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Link added to Jackson Lab's MGI Mouse Orthologs</h2> 
<p>
There is now a link from the known genes details page to the Jackson Lab's MGI Mouse Ortholog when 
the ortholog is known. Thanks to Carol Bult for her help setting up this link.</p> 

<h2>Nov. 28, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Duplications track released for August browser</h2> 
<p>
A duplications track is now available in the August browser. This track shows duplicate blocks of 
sequence larger than 1000 bases. The track is hidden by default. To open it look for
&quot;Duplications&quot; in the third row of track controls under the main graphic window, and 
change the setting to &quot;dense&quot;. Thanks to Evan Eichler and Jeff Bailey for this track.</p>

<h2>Nov. 28, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Sanger Curated Gene annotations now available on chromosome 20</h2> 
<p>
Sanger curated gene annotations are now available on chromosome 20. Thanks to Jennifer Ashurst, 
James Gilbert, and all the annotators at the Sanger Institute.</p>

<h2>Nov. 27, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Haplotype blocks annotation released for chromosome 21</h2> 
<p>
A new track has been added to the August freeze browser showing haplotype blocks derived from 
common SNPs on Chromosome 21 by Perlegen, as described in 
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5547/1719">Common High-Resolution 
Haplotypes</a>. Patil, N. et. al. Science 294:1719-1723 (2001).</p>

<h2>Nov. 19, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; SNP and mouse blat tracks available</h2> 
<p>
The SNP and Mouse Blat tracks are now available for August. The Mouse Blat track uses a partial 
assembly of the public whole genome shotgun data courtesy of Whitehead's Arachne program.</p>

<h2>Nov. 8, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Interface of track details pages updated</h2> 
<p>
The detail web pages for each of the tracks have been updated to reflect the overall look and design
of this site.  You will now see the familiar blue navigation bar with links to the Browser, BLAT, 
Downloads, and the  FAQ page from each of the track detail pages.</p>

<h2>Nov. 8, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; STS Markers track updated on Apr. and Aug. browsers</h2> 
<p>
The STS Markers track has been updated on the April and August browsers to now include much more 
information on the detail page including links to UniSTS and details on the alignments of the 
markers to the draft sequence. In addition, all known aliases of the markers can be entered in the 
&quot;position&quot; window, and the corresponding merker will be found and displayed if its 
location has been determined.</p>

<h2>Nov. 8, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; FISH Clones track added to Apr. and Aug. browsers</h2> 
<p>
A new FISH Clones track has been added to the April and August browsers. Previously, this 
information has been included in the STS Markers track. Now, this has been broken out into a 
separate track with additional information provided on the detail page not previously shown.</p>

<h2>Nov. 6, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Fgenesh++ gene predictions and cross-species mRNA tracks available</h2> 
<p>
The fgenesh++ gene prediction and the cross-species mRNA tracks are now available in the August 
browser.</p> 

<h2>Oct. 31, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; DNA button functionality upgraded</h2> 
<p>
The &quot;DNA&quot; button at the top of the browser has been significantly upgraded. By default it 
now returns DNA that has repeating elements in lower case and other DNA in upper case. There is also
an option to color the DNA output with various tracks.  You can have the case and font features such
as underline, bold, and italic follow tracks too.</p> 

<h2>Oct. 28, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; TIGR Gene Index track added to April browser</h2> 
<p>
There is now a TIGR Gene Index track in the Apr. 2001 freeze browser. The TIGR Gene Index is based 
on alignments of assembled ESTs from a number of species. Be sure to click into the track and follow
the outside links to the TIGR site, which contains a wealth of information on the genes.</p>

<h2>Oct. 29, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Acembly track updated on August browser</h2> 
<p>
The Acembly track on the Aug. 2001 freeze has been updated to include predictions based on human 
ESTs and GenBank mRNAs as well as RefSeq human mRNAs. Protein predictions are now also available in 
the details page for this track. The outside link for this track is also very informative.</p>

<h2>Oct. 27, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Share your custom annotation tracks!</h2> 
<p>
You can now share your custom tracks with the community. The easiest way to do this is to construct 
a link from your own web pages to the browser. Here is an example of a URL for such a link:

        hgt.customText=http://genome.ucsc.edu/test.bed</pre></p>
<p> 
The position variable tells the browser which part of the genome to display. The db variable refers 
to the freeze number. hg8 corresponds to the August 2001 freeze. The customText variable should 
refer to a URL containing plain text in one of the formats described in 
<a href="help/customTrack.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html</a>.</p>
<p> 
Note that generally we only keep the last three versions of the genome online (hg6, hg7, and hg8).  
You'll have to update your link and track about every 4 months as a result.</p> 
<p>
Please send in the URLs of tracks you'd like to share to 
<a href="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;">&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;</a>, 
<!-- above address is genome at soe.ucsc.edu --> 
along with a brief description of the track and the genome version it is tied to. We'll create an 
index page of these here.</p> 
<p>
You can also access an external custom track by including the URL of the track data (on a separate 
line starting with http://) in the custom track box at the bottom of the browser gateway.</p>

<h2>Oct. 15, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Weekly updates of tab-delimited data files</h2> 
<p>
Fresh tab-delimited files from the browser database are now available. They will now be updated 
automatically every Sunday evening. The table browser queries the database directly, so it is always
up to the minute.</p>

<h2>Oct. 12, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; New gene prediction tracks for Apr. and Aug. browsers</h2> 
<p>
Several new sets of gene predictions came in this week. We now have fgenesh++ predictions for the 
April freeze, and Genscan and Acembly predictions for the August freeze.</p>

<h2>Oct. 11, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Table Browser upgraded</h2> 
<p>
Why struggle with massive genomic file downloads when the UCSC 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> lets you select exactly the track data desired via 
a convenient web interface? Major new improvements by Krish Roskin have empowered and simplified 
this feature available now for the three most recent assemblies.</p>

<h2>Oct. 8, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Oct. 2000 assembly moved to archives</h2> 
<p>
The October 2000 assembly has been moved to the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg5/">archives</a> to make room for the August 
assembly.</p>
	
<h2>Oct. 5, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Revised Aug. 2001 assembly released</h2> 
<p>
A revised Aug. 2001 freeze assembly is now up. The problems with flipped contigs of finished clones 
and high levels of sequence duplication are fixed. You can now download this assembly 
<a href="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg8/">in bulk</a> as well as browse it. 
Chromosome by chromosome and annotation database files will be following over the next day or 
two.</p>

<h2>Oct. 2, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Convert coordinates between different draft assemblies</h2> 
<p>
You can now convert coordinates between different versions of the draft using a new program, 
hgCoordConv, written by Chuck Sugnet. hgCoordConv attempts to cut out sequences of the original 
draft and align them to the new draft. When aligning the sequences to the new draft hgCoordConv 
makes sure that the sequences are in the same order, orientation, and have the correct distances 
between them.</p> 
<p>
Chuck has also implemented a SAGE/Unigene track in the browser. This track displays data from the 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/" target="_blank">SAGEMap project at NCBI</a>. UniGene 
cluster sequences are displayed in the browser and colored according to their average SAGE counts 
over a series of experiments. Selecting one of the UniGene representative sequences displays the 
SAGE results for UniGene sequences.</p>

<h2>Sep. 21, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Clone order problems found in preliminary Aug. 2001 assembly</h2> 
<p>
Some systematic problems were found in the clone order on the preliminary Aug. 2001 freeze assembly.
The sequencing center at Washington University, EBI's Ensembl group, and our group here at UCSC 
are currently working together to revise the merged BAC clone maps and the assembly process to fix 
these problems. We hope to update the August browser with a revised assembly soon. Then, after 
further testing via the browser, we will release the assembled August freeze genome sequence 
itself.</p>

<h2>Sep. 11, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary Aug. 2001 assembly now available in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p>
A preliminary assembly of the Aug. 2001 freeze is now available in the genome browser. Due to 
significant progress by the mapping and finishing groups of the international public consortium, 
this assembly is a major improvement over the Apr. 2001 freeze assembly. Imre Vastrik, Ewan Birney 
and colleagues at Ensembl have computed a merge of BAC clone maps provided by the individual 
sequencing centers with fingerprint-based maps prepared at Washington University. These merged maps 
were used for the first time in this Aug. assembly.</p> 
<p>
The Aug. assembly has successfully passed our internal quality control tests. We will release the 
sequence and annotations in bulk downloadable form in a week or so, after the external testers have 
had a chance to further verify it. Meanwhile if you notice any systematic problems please let us 
know at 
<a href="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;"> &#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#101;.&#117;&#99;s&#99;.&#101;d&#117;</a>.

Though the state of the working draft has improved considerably, remember that where you see solid 
marks in the Gap track, the relative order and orientation of flanking contigs is still uncertain. 
In some cases of complex repeat structure it is also possible that the assembly may be incorrect 
even in the absence of gaps. Also, sometimes ambiguities in the data cause a BAC clone to be split, 
with parts of it placed at opposite ends of a run of other clones. Localized errors of this type 
should be corrected by additional finishing efforts at the individual sequencing centers and should 
not be reported to UCSC. However, please report any large-scale or systematic problems you detect 
with this assembly that could have been caused by our data processing.</p> 
<p>
The tracks available on the August 2001 browser are quite limited at the moment. More tracks will 
show up over time.</p>

<h2>Sep. 11, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Apr. 2001 assembly is new default in Genome Browser</h2> 
<p>
The Apr. 2001 assembly is now the default for the browser. The SNP and Ensembl gene tracks have come
in for this version. There is also a new track depicting non-human vertebrate mRNA alignments.</p> 
<p>
The Sept. 2000 and Jul. 2000 versions of the genome are now only available on our archive site.
Please see the link in the blue box to the left for more details.</p> 
<p>
The Aug. 6 freeze is progressing through the pipeline. We've recently received an updated accession 
map from Wash U.  Ensembl will shortly be integrating this with chromosome specific maps from the 
sequencing centers. We are still on track for an early September next release.</p>

<h2>Aug. 28, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; Custom annotation track functionality added</h2> 
<p> 
Meanwhile we've been continuing work on the Genome Browser. It's now possible  to upload your own 
annotations to be displayed alongside the  built-in tracks. Please scroll to the bottom of the 
browser gateway pages for further information. The browser has also been sped up, particularly on 
the larger chromosomes by using a &quot;binning&quot; technique suggested by Lincoln Stein and 
Richard Durbin.</p>

<h2>Aug. 23, 2001 &nbsp;&nbsp; New annotation tracks on Apr. 2001 browser</h2> 
<p>
Tracks continue to be added to the <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg7/">Apr. 
2001 browser</a>. Our old friend the Exofish track is back. The blat mouse homology track is now up 
as well, computed at somewhat more sensitive settings than it was in the Dec. 2000 browser.</p> 
<p>
We've recently received some significant funding from NHGRI to maintain and extend this site. This 
has allowed us among other things to hire an artist, Jenny Draper, who is responsible for the new 
look.</p>

<h2>Apr. 1, 2001 Freeze</h2>
<p>
Jul. 13, 2001: fixed bug where some UTRs were mis-annotated in the known genes on the minus 
strand.</p>

<h2>Dec. 12, 2000 Freeze</h2>
<p>
Jul. 13, 2001: fixed bug where some UTRs were mis-annotated in the known genes on the minus 
strand.</p>
<p>
Apr. 5, 2001: chromosome level files (but not contig level files) updated to fix bug where some of 
the centromeres were misplaced</p>
<p>
Apr. 1, 2001: chromosome Y updated to fix a bug that put a large gap between each clone. This bug 
was limited to the Y chromosome.</p>

<h2>Oct. 7, 2000 Freeze</h2>
<p>
Apr. 7, 2001: Affymetrix gene predictions updated and available for bulk download.</p>
<p>
Jan. 9, 2001: all files were updated after a bug that had caused some finished clones to be flipped 
in the assembly was caught and fixed. Our apologies for any inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>
Nov. 10, 2000: the sequence (.fa) files for two contigs: X/ctg18523/ctg18523.fa and 
7/ctg15082/ctg15082.fa were updated. These files had null (zero valued) characters that have been 
replaced with N characters. These characters were a result of a mismatch between clone sizes in the 
map and in finished NT contigs. The sequence for chromosomes X and 7, which contain these contigs, 
has also been updated.</p> 
<p>
<h2>Sep. 5, 2000 Freeze</h2> 
<p>
Oct. 11, 2000: chr21.agp and chr22.fa were updated. chr21.agp was a version which went with the UCSC
draft assembly rather than the Sanger/NCBI final assembly of this chromosome. chr21.agp and chr21.fa
are now in sync.   chr22.fa and chr22.agp were also previously out of sync. chr22.fa was obtained 
from Sanger while chr22.agp had been obtained by NCBI. With this update they are consistent, both 
NCBI versions. Apologies for any rework this causes you.</p> 
<p>
Oct. 9, 2000: chr21_random.* and chr22_random.* were removed from the zip-files in the Sep. 5 
freeze.  These files were relics that should not have been included in the first place.  The files
chr9_random.agp, chr10_random.agp, chr11_random.agp, chr12_random.agp, chr13_random.agp and 
chr14_random.agp were updated. There was a bug where the initial field of the initial lines in these
files was &quot;null)&quot; rather than &quot;chrN_random&quot; as it should have been.</p>
<p>
<h2>Jul. 17, 2000 Freeze</h2>
<p>
Sep. 22, 2000: The zip-files chromFa.zip and chromAgp.zip under the Jul. 17th full data set were 
updated to fix some duplications of clone contigs that occurred in the chrN_random.agp and 
chrN_random.fa files contained within these zip-files. These &quot;_random&quot; files contain 
clone contigs that were mapped to a particular chromosome, but could not be placed at a specific 
position within that chromosome. They correspond to the &quot;RANDOM&quot; sections of the WashU 
map. None of the regular chrN.agp or chrN.fa files were affected by this update, nor was any of the 
information in the contigAgp.zip or contigFa.zip files changed. For convenience, we include two new 
files, chromRandAgp.zip and chromRandFa.zip, for users who would like to download only the data that
has changed. These zips consist of the updated chrN_random.agp and chrN_random.fa files, 
respectively.</p>
<p>
Sep. 4, 2000: The files chromFa.zip and contigFa.zip under the July 17th full data set and the files
under July 17th data by individual clone contig were updated to fix some incorrect (null(0)) 
characters that needed to be replaced by 'n' characters in some Fasta files. The following contig 
Fasta files on chromosomes 1,8,11,12,16, 17 and 19 were affected:</p> <pre>
    1/ctg14250/ctg14250.fa
    8/ctg17325/ctg17325.fa
    8/ctg16307/ctg16307.fa
    8/ctg25150/ctg25150.fa
    8/ctg15216/ctg15216.fa
    11/ctg15548/ctg15548.fa
    12/ctg15285/ctg15285.fa
    16/ctg16864/ctg16864.fa
    16/ctg28077/ctg28077.fa
    16/ctg13970/ctg13970.fa
    16/ctg25401/ctg25401.fa
    16/ctg13336/ctg13336.fa
    16/ctg14937/ctg14937.fa
    16/ctg16860/ctg16860.fa
    16/ctg17794/ctg17794.fa
    17/ctg14047/ctg14047.fa
    19/ctg16564/ctg16564.fa </pre>

<p> 
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>
