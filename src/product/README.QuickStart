Getting a browser up and running quickly in a minimal state
(see also: http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Browser_installation)

The browser can be made to operate with a bare minimum of tables
for the purpose of demonstrating the CGI binaries are functioning.

The only tables you need to load for this are:

1. all tables in the hgcentral database
2. six tables in the human genome

Create an empty hgcentral database:
$ hgsql -e "create database hgcentral;" mysql

Load all tables into the hgcentral database.
Copy all the mysql data files from
    rsync -avP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/mysql/hgcentral/ .
directly into the MySQL data area for your hgcentral database.
(something usually like /var/lib/mysql/hgcentral/)
(or load this database with mysql/hgsql commands and the hgcentral.sql
	text file dump of these tables from:
    rsync -avP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/genome/admin/hgcentral.sql .
    (or: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/hgcentral.sql)
)

And then six tables for the latest human database.
The gateway page always needs a minimum human database in order
to function even if the browser is being built for the primary
purpose of displaying other genomes.  This default can currently
be changed in the source tree in src/hg/lib/hdb.c
(to be done: specify this default in hg.conf file)

Start with an empty database, for example hg18:
$ hgsql -e "create database hg18;" mysql

Again, copy the MySQL files directly from the download
server, for example hg18:
    rsync -avP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/mysql/hg18/ .
    (beware, this is an immense amount of data)
into your MySQL data area.  Or load these tables from the text SQL
dumps from:
    rsync -avP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/database/ .
    (beware, this is an immense amount of data)

The minimal set of tables required are:
grp
trackDb
hgFindSpec
chromInfo
gold
gap

The gap table is an example of the split table concept for performance
purposes.  It consists of the tables: chr*_gap which is a total
of 49 tables just for the gap track.  (3 * 49 = 147 MySQL data files)

(each MySQL data table is three files: .MYD .MYI and .frm files)

With this set of six tables the gateway page will
begin to function and the browser page and table browser
will function.  Other browser functions are not ready yet without
additional tables and databases.  This is a bare minimum just to
demonstrate the CGI binaries are working.

This will all work even without copying any files for the /gbdb/
data area, although most functions will not work, such as fetching
the DNA sequence from a browser view.  The DNA sequence for
an assembly is found in, for example hg18: /gbdb/hg18/nib/chr*.nib
Some assemblies have all the DNA sequence in a single .2bit file,
for example: /gbdb/mm8/mm8.2bit
