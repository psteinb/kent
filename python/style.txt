Naming Conventions

Packages and Modules
    All lowercase names, no spaces. Underscores if it would improve
readability in modules, but not for use in packages. Need to discuss how
classes are organized in packages and files and where programs are stored.

Classes
    CapitalCase names. Note the leading captial letter to distinguish between a
ClassName and a functionName. Underscores are not used, except for private
internal classes, where the name is preceded by double underscores which
Python recognizes as private.

Methods
    mixedCase names. The leading character is not captialized, but all
successive words are capitalized. Underscores are not used, except for private
internal methods, where the name is preceded by double underscores which
Python recognizes as private.

Variables
    mixedCase names. Underscores are not used, except for private
internal variables, where the name is preceded by double underscores which
Python recognizes as private.

Testing
    Testing is carried out using the unittest module in python. This module
allows for self-running scripts which only need the following lines at the
bottom of the script:
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

    The scripts themselves are composed of one or more classes, all of which
inherit from unittest.TestCase and contain one or more methods which use
various asserts or failure checks to determine whether a test passes or not.
Testing is self-contained, and should provide its own input and output
directories and files.
